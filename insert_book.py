Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun. . . . In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister\'s place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Hunger-Games-Book-One-01/dp/0439023521/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LEijA1w7diIrj5tMnqaYFuuMywYqqHsnxN9GL0uIYcgMZpGazPBSmXSN-j44AwzIVIkK4iNW5zRTwzr5eZ-ClhKEBAmKD8tpaxaMHCbQdrfYz0SfUZyR5K7pvSibp-2e9EpVeCkIVlb1Mo9LtBqZsS_F3fMRDdayOWgMe1cmR60cpHtGIV129M3kQGlVyjuJcyRBJEZvb_7_-VR1IGj7L5ZQpQufdBN5tnoJnSyP_4Nf5iXzzqcXUjflTsm0iK8dQkjd7UGzESZMRA3oi-0Srfl8Wd2dIqAY4ZsHb6xO534.ts3IfpBIPvsT2C-xJSNRhk8zQCeuKkUqK52oZGYIMlg&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Hunger+Games+book&qid=1713330773&sr=8-1", 1),

Scott Fitzgerald, The Great GatsbyThe Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, the novel depicts narrator Nick Carraway\'s interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby\'s obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.A youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island\'s North Shore in 1922 inspired the novel. Following a move to the French Riviera, he completed a rough draft in 1924. He submitted the draft to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After his revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book\'s title and considered several alternatives. The final title he desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. Painter Francis Cugat\'s final cover design impressed Fitzgerald who incorporated a visual element from the art into the novel.Gatsby continues to attract popular and scholarly attention. The novel was most recently adapted to film in 2013 by director Baz Luhrmann, while contemporary scholars emphasize the novel\'s treatment of social class, inherited wealth compared to those who are self-made, race, environmentalism, and its cynical attitude towards the American dream. The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary masterpiece and a contender for the title of the Great American Novel.A True Classic that Belongs on Every Bookshelf!", "https://www.amazon.sg/Great-Gatsby-Original-Fitzgerald-Classic/dp/B093MYWTT5/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.BhTVkE9rT2Vd0vVk4-aTzMTEJF3ngPK28_fEbVrtZLaqHCgmZNZeX50vj6v4yvtUYZ5cJRvhXEkRnkbT6QVExdqBSEeXGFZ9t73rg8X0Zuy0BOLhCa3m0kJlv7hJ_wR0o3df-g1O0pUSRoUf5-ghbG4q9IppKGh1esYUiDHIIDxtyRyYhadLY7w5CNvX18PKnEF8-V4LdHHtCy5Y7h7G5M5w5wCVZuumXVHpW9KZlAR7Th5_UtnZ5ZBTK-EWkYrnQ69MF2w9aJYbLnyiubt-MXTmFKUAoCM8xJzwW4N8xWs.WxxHrPqU6Wby4Mq2gvXtJzq_J8uxXgdHFfQFtmjJwbE&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Great+Gatsby+book&qid=1713330806&sr=8-1", 5),

Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness.  Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate—a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister—and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.  My Sister’s Keeper examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child’s life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you?

Over a decade ago, Simon Sinek started a movement that inspired millions to demand purpose at work, to ask what was the WHY of their organization. Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, and these ideas remain as relevant and timely as ever. START WITH WHY asks (and answers) the questions: why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won\'t truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it.  START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who have had the greatest influence in the world all think, act and communicate the same way—and it\'s the opposite of what everyone else does.

They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it—from garden seeds to Scripture—is calamitously transformed on African soil. What follows is a suspenseful epic of one family’s tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa.The novel is set against one of the most dramatic political chronicles of the twentieth century: the Congo\'s fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of its first elected prime minister, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the insidious progress of a world economic order that robs the fledgling African nation of its autonomy. Taking its place alongside the classic works of postcolonial literature, this ambitious novel establishes Kingsolver as one of the most thoughtful and daring of modern writers.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Poisonwood-Bible-Novel-Barbara-Kingsolver/dp/0061577073/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.c357RjD3js6BiXkRoBaxvH5npc_Kh3ALCoGuhTXNZKEX9CxVvf1Iu6jevkP_VdV8yzbsW4Ok53lPa1D8X6JPXcrSAkPxgq9qK04rXiFf17sugF92csJBm-Dn5uXOXKQWJNuURmwuDxqABc9ZXaGkAu4gRd7sm8TT2VOtQru01jV85nrEN0QSMkgqSdCcuwmMdCELIiZObeGUXv77UtZsMuTXHFGJSF1SULy1_LnIOfKEKjzQL-qSS2lLGr1mNzGX3rkV8eRdwZfnuZO6s3f-Pdk9ZJS0wsMKGf7d3AHh_60.OB3ZzIVcx7MO12MRK1dd2rF-E8-_gPQp1IGtGv98RGo&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Poisonwood+Bible+book&qid=1713331861&sr=8-1", 100),

Isaacson’s portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics. This Penguin Classics edition contains an introduction and notes by Steinbeck scholar Robert Demott.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

As a teenager, he channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics. But when World War II began, the athlete became an airman, embarking on a journey that led to a doomed flight on a May afternoon in 1943. When his Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean, against all odds, Zamperini survived, adrift on a foundering life raft. Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.   Appearing in paperback for the first time—with twenty arresting new photos and an extensive Q&A with the author—Unbroken is an unforgettable testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit, brought vividly to life by Seabiscuit author Laura Hillenbrand.Hailed as the top nonfiction book of the year by Time magazine • Winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for biography and the Indies Choice Adult Nonfiction Book of the Year award   “Extraordinarily moving . . . a powerfully drawn survival epic.”—The Wall Street Journal   “[A] one-in-a-billion story . . . designed to wrench from self-respecting critics all the blurby adjectives we normally try to avoid: It is amazing, unforgettable, gripping, harrowing, chilling, and inspiring.”—New York   “Staggering . . . mesmerizing . . .

This Penguin Classics edition contains an introduction by Andrew Delblanco, with explanatory commentary by Tom Quirk.\'Call me Ishmael.\'So begins Herman Melville\'s masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. As Ishmael is drawn into Captain Ahab\'s obsessive quest to slay the white whale Moby-Dick, he finds himself engaged in a metaphysical struggle between good and evil. More than just a novel of adventure, more than an paean to whaling lore and legend, Moby-Dick is a haunting social commentary, populated by some of the most enduring characters in literature; the crew of the Pequod, from stern, Quaker First Mate Starbuck, to the tattooed Polynesian harpooner Queequeg, are a vision of the world in microcosm, the pinnacle of Melville\'s lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is a profound, poetic inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.Based on the Northwestern University Press edition, this Penguin Classics edition includes a critical introduction by Andrew Delbanco, as well as valuable explanatory notes, maps, illustrations and a glossary of nautical terms.Herman Melville is now regarded as one of America\'s greatest novelists. Much of the material for his novels was drawn from his own experience as a seaman aboard whaling ships. He wrote his masterpiece Moby-Dick in 1851, and died in 1891.If you enjoyed Moby-Dick, you may like Miguel de Cervantes\' Don Quixote, also available in Penguin Classics.\'After reading Moby-Dick, you will have enhanced your sense of wonder, you will have increased the size of your universe\'E.

Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.” January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she’s never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb. . . . As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society’s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever. Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.Praise for The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society“A jewel . . .

Henson, Danielle Brooks, and Fantasia Barrino. Celebrating its fortieth anniversary, The Color Purple writes a message of healing, forgiveness, self-discovery, and sisterhood to a new generation of readers. An inspiration to authors who continue to give voice to the multidimensionality of Black women\'s stories, including Tayari Jones, Honorée Fanonne Jeffers, Jesmyn Ward, and more, The Color Purple remains an essential read in conversation with storytellers today. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award A powerful cultural touchstone of modern American literature, The Color Purple depicts the lives of African American women in early-twentieth-century rural Georgia. Separated as girls, sisters Celie and Nettie sustain their loyalty to and hope in each other across time, distance, and silence. Through a series of letters spanning nearly thirty years, first from Celie to God, then from the sisters to each other, the novel draws readers into a rich and memorable portrayal of Black women--their pain and struggle, companionship and growth, resilience and bravery. Deeply compassionate and beautifully imagined, The Color Purple breaks the silence around domestic and sexual abuse, and carries readers on an epic and spirit-affirming journey toward transformation, redemption, and love. \"Reading The Color Purple was the first time I had seen Southern, Black women\'s literature as world literature. In writing us into the world--bravely, unapologetically, and honestly--Alice Walker has given us a gift we will never be able to repay.\" --Tayari Jones \"The Color Purple was what church should have been, what honest familial reckoning could have been, and it is still the only art object in the world by which all three generations of Black artists in my family judge American art.\" --Kiese Laymon", "https://www.amazon.sg/Color-Purple-Alice-Walker/dp/0143135694/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Ym8RByfRCoZpgbE_LeNQw-AOu3YPmIcRSEzKAureziUYdcSCJgPnBeSEdH80se0g_4896GVS_bYEtGZ2vTHs6JetzVxmG2Y6En_1Xunai110tMyudaqQlb1B692PFusnSvVXiCOf0KUXIayuQnPYgN4EPcSkuh9v2dIwh7jE8qkJVV54sYR-LRuaOh8SylMFX9GH5YtkdpKJoOBG007aTS8agQCTQqSWpyegL-Zxobg-lhXJSVe4VCmLw2TK-8xpi5tbVcmGQXrRiv_QZtdEHOncW9WRzlvWWyzSgVlrn1Y.aLzyYHC_Ja3rsSgsklKttMlvDKrMndCpyspz6UB4BbE&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Color+Purple+book&qid=1713332759&sr=8-1", 198),

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells--taken without her knowledge--became one of the most important tools in medicine: The first \"immortal\" human cells grown in culture, which are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb\'s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Henrietta\'s family did not learn of her \"immortality\" until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family--past and present--is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family--especially Henrietta\'s daughter Deborah. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn\'t her children afford health insurance?

Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police.

It doesn’t hurt that this truth is stranger than fiction.” —The New York TimesCombining meticulous research with nail-biting storytelling, Erik Larson has crafted a narrative with all the wonder of newly discovered history and the thrills of the best fiction.Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America’s rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair’s brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country’s most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his “World’s Fair Hotel” just west of the fairgrounds—a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.The Devil in the White City draws the reader into the enchantment of the Guilded Age, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others. Erik Larson’s gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Devil-White-City-Madness-Changed/dp/0375725601/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TjoLU5RyC5Vqoey7E2ozOgL83Y8OsP-9cY2_wWC91cfGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.qxwROoqyoNiGMnzbjIqo2ycJRbZ8bnTFjF1PjHIWrHw&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Devil+in+the+White+City%3A+Murder%2C+Magic%2C+and+Madness+at+the+Fair+that+Changed+America+book&qid=1713332913&sr=8-1", 217),

Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.The masterpiece of Steinbeck’s later years, East of Eden is a work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love\'s absence. Adapted for the 1955 film directed by Elia Kazan introducing James Dean and read by thousands as the book that brought Oprah’s Book Club back, East of Eden has remained vitally present in American culture for over half a century.This edition features an introduction by David Wyatt.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

The first ten lies they tell you in high school. Speak up for yourself--we want to know what you have to say. From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication.  In Laurie Halse Anderson\'s powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school. She speaks for many a disenfranchised teenager while demonstrating the importance of speaking up for oneself.

Everest Disaster", "S$26.15", "Jon Krakauer ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Iyp8W4SmL._SY466_.jpg", "#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER • The epic account of the storm on the summit of Mt. Everest that claimed five lives and left countless more—including Krakauer\'s—in guilt-ridden disarray. \"A harrowing tale of the perils of high-altitude climbing, a story of bad luck and worse judgment and of heartbreaking heroism.\" —PEOPLEA bank of clouds was assembling on the not-so-distant horizon, but journalist-mountaineer Jon Krakauer, standing on the summit of Mt. Everest, saw nothing that \"suggested that a murderous storm was bearing down.\" He was wrong. By writing Into Thin Air, Krakauer may have hoped to exorcise some of his own demons and lay to rest some of the painful questions that still surround the event. He takes great pains to provide a balanced picture of the people and events he witnessed and gives due credit to the tireless and dedicated Sherpas. He also avoids blasting easy targets such as Sandy Pittman, the wealthy socialite who brought an espresso maker along on the expedition. Krakauer\'s highly personal inquiry into the catastrophe provides a great deal of insight into what went wrong. But for Krakauer himself, further interviews and investigations only lead him to the conclusion that his perceived failures were directly responsible for a fellow climber\'s death. Clearly, Krakauer remains haunted by the disaster, and although he relates a number of incidents in which he acted selflessly and even heroically, he seems unable to view those instances objectively. In the end, despite his evenhanded and even generous assessment of others\' actions, he reserves a full measure of vitriol for himself. This updated trade paperback edition of Into Thin Air includes an extensive new postscript that sheds fascinating light on the acrimonious debate that flared between Krakauer and Everest guide Anatoli Boukreev in the wake of the tragedy.  \"I have no doubt that Boukreev\'s intentions were good on summit day,\" writes Krakauer in the postscript, dated August 1999. \"What disturbs me, though, was Boukreev\'s refusal to acknowledge the possibility that he made even a single poor decision. Never did he indicate that perhaps it wasn\'t the best choice to climb without gas or go down ahead of his clients.\" As usual, Krakauer supports his points with dogged research and a good dose of humility. But rather than continue the heated discourse that has raged since Into Thin Air\'s denouncement of guide Boukreev, Krakauer\'s tone is conciliatory; he points most of his criticism at G. Weston De Walt, who coauthored The Climb, Boukreev\'s version of events. And in a touching conclusion, Krakauer recounts his last conversation with the late Boukreev, in which the two weathered climbers agreed to disagree about certain points. Krakauer had great hopes to patch things up with Boukreev, but the Russian later died in an avalanche on another Himalayan peak, Annapurna I. In 1999, Krakauer received an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters--a prestigious prize intended \"to honor writers of exceptional accomplishment.\"  According to the Academy\'s citation, \"Krakauer combines the tenacity and courage of the finest tradition of investigative journalism with the stylish subtlety and profound insight of the born writer.  His account of an ascent of Mount Everest has led to a general reevaluation of climbing and of the commercialization of what was once a romantic, solitary sport; while his account of the life and death of Christopher McCandless, who died of starvation after challenging the Alaskan wilderness, delves even more deeply and disturbingly into the fascination of nature and the devastating effects of its lure on a young and curious mind.\"", "https://www.amazon.sg/Into-Thin-Air-Personal-Disaster/dp/0385494785/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.s0bEC4khWN1n6Os5DFsn7l1QThCO7ec2DHw_gvzqnvBAG6fIiFmiljMrVX3hpO3ZTci-LIvQCDuwkLk5fBo3xPthkLflx0snG0Xy2eTj6_k.d5G0eIgYeVr0ms4e2X6alXFwjo1ktAxhMvvfr6Lj864&dib_tag=se&keywords=Into+Thin+Air%3A+A+Personal+Account+of+the+Mt.+Everest+Disaster+book&qid=1713333084&sr=8-1", 236),

It celebrates the art and craft of Hemingway’s quintessential story of the Lost Generation—presented by the Hemingway family with illuminating supplementary material from the Hemingway Collection at the John F. Kennedy Library. A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway’s most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates. It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illusions. First published in 1926, The Sun Also Rises is “an absorbing, beautifully and tenderly absurd, heartbreaking narrative...a truly gripping story, told in lean, hard, athletic prose” (The New York Times). The Hemingway Library Edition commemorates Hemingway’s classic novel with a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, the author’s sole surviving son, and an introduction by Sean Hemingway, grandson of the author. Hemingway considered the extensive rewriting that he did to shape his first novel the most difficult job of his life.

Often scorned by neighbors for her family’s erratic and eccentric behavior―such as her father Johnny’s taste for alcohol and Aunt Sissy’s habit of marrying serially without the formality of divorce―no one, least of all Francie, could say that the Nolans’ life lacked drama. By turns overwhelming, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the Nolans’ daily experiences are raw with honestly and tenderly threaded with family connectedness. Betty Smith has, in the pages of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, captured the joys of humble Williamsburg life―from “junk day” on Saturdays, when the children traded their weekly take for pennies, to the special excitement of holidays, bringing cause for celebration and revelry. Smith has created a work of literary art that brilliantly captures a unique time and place as well as deeply resonant moments of universal experience. Here is an American classic that \"cuts right to the heart of life,\" hails the New York Times. \"If you miss A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, you will deny yourself a rich experience.\"", "https://www.amazon.sg/Tree-Grows-Brooklyn-75th-Anniversary/dp/0060736267/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6ZpaPBIb6TT158yrEvYIYX2uLFSFwq-jV6ZybpZbbhJSUTW1T5kbPeXfiGWulVOF2Yd9s3yG03jGSIc_XScFzWav0xAZTAwz2O9FMoDkFnLEzkNJ1moTkDNkzmxgC0fuxUH7Y8TPuSpPJp9tEX_Ql7lWVqb2gtC1RCSxp6Rvbicd59D4yoMuzQYyJHKAG1qAHL9IdkbWOLTKEpum9kOL1C8agQCTQqSWpyegL-ZxobiMbNiPS2T2eIfw9ZpHLeQtVX_e56zUGFHcpeCdayOqwZVE93GtPApYm0EC9flNLbk.c2-sJ5ObwRRpkMRrJ-AgXvc4y0wKo6aghE2N8cxlbpI&dib_tag=se&keywords=A+Tree+Grows+In+Brooklyn+book&qid=1713333355&sr=8-1", 265),

Siren Seven is wrapping up their farewell tour, and Ariel can\'t wait to spend the summer just living a normal life--part of a world she\'s only ever seen from the outside. But her father, the head of Atlantica Records, has other plans: begin her breakout solo career immediately, starting with a splashy announcement on a morning talk show. The night before, Ariel and her sisters sneak out of their Manhattan penthouse for a night of incognito fun at a rock concert in Brooklyn. It\'s there that Ariel crosses paths with Eric Reyes, dreamy lead singer of an up-and-coming band. Unaware of her true identity, Eric spontaneously invites her on the road for the summer.

She has nothing but time now, as she recounts the tale of Snow Flower, and asks the gods for forgiveness. In nineteenth-century China, when wives and daughters were foot-bound and lived in almost total seclusion, the women in one remote Hunan county developed their own secret code for communication: nu shu (“women’s writing”). Some girls were paired with laotongs, “old sames,” in emotional matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. With the arrival of a silk fan on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their friendship is sealed and they become “old sames” at the tender age of seven. As the years pass, through famine and rebellion, they reflect upon their arranged marriages, loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their lifelong friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a brilliantly realistic journey back to an era of Chinese history that is as deeply moving as it is sorrowful. With the period detail and deep resonance of Memoirs of a Geisha, this lyrical and emotionally charged novel delves into one of the most mysterious of human relationships: female friendship.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Snow-Flower-Secret-Fan-Novel/dp/0812980352/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ihpOeYZ8WNktV9wVZKdHIlW87svD8H_aG3uxk_zcDgzahqxWeijygl7SuwJfRgFv7ItWwXbM03htar28K7mKno1fByy_mreJzxhTHXMW0zlfupPjgN5h9xmf-Y6R3BVjyDs2sCtGEFammjLM4o45f0Ef5YU6WcK56YV_knyW7Nu0sEGHg53K3IUYf7avXeWBQQ3DyallwQiKDBpLG0DcncflI0avjyceAMF435RoHM3x277iFzPbS3IgeZe9caz7blFZnOP3YSBRwKxJmG1VIkDLcBhu0ZbpzgDx2SBXMJU.3xQ98gaTtfNREy9MCA7ittabJMyMIfE63w6xY2uR-1U&dib_tag=se&keywords=Snow+Flower+and+the+Secret+Fan+book&qid=1713333429&sr=8-1", 273),

Would they be adopted by a kind and loving family, or would they face a childhood and adolescence of hard labor and servitude?As a young Irish immigrant, Vivian Daly was one such child, sent by rail from New York City to an uncertain future a world away. Returning east later in life, Vivian leads a quiet, peaceful existence on the coast of Maine, the memories of her upbringing rendered a hazy blur.

So when he’s finally able to save up enough money for two pups to call his own—Old Dan and Little Ann—he’s ecstatic. It doesn’t matter that times are tough; together they’ll roam the hills of the Ozarks.   Soon Billy and his hounds become the finest hunting team in the valley.

You can\'t help but cheer his victory.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review  By the time he entered a drug and alcohol treatment facility, James Frey had taken his addictions to near-deadly extremes. He had so thoroughly ravaged his body that the facility’s doctors were shocked he was still alive. The ensuing torments of detoxification and withdrawal, and the never-ending urge to use chemicals, are captured with a vitality and directness that recalls the seminal eye-opening power of William Burroughs’s Junky.  But A Million Little Pieces refuses to fit any mold of drug literature. Inside the clinic, James is surrounded by patients as troubled as he is—including a judge, a mobster, a one-time world-champion boxer, and a fragile former prostitute to whom he is not allowed to speak—but their friendship and advice strikes James as stronger and truer than the clinic’s droning dogma of How to Recover. James refuses to consider himself a victim of anything but his own bad decisions, and insists on accepting sole accountability for the person he has been and the person he may become—which runs directly counter to his counselors\' recipes for recovery.  James has to fight to find his own way to confront the consequences of the life he has lived so far, and to determine what future, if any, he holds. It is this fight, told with the charismatic energy and power of One Flew over the Cuckoo\'s Nest, that is at the heart of A Million Little Pieces: the fight between one young man’s will and the ever-tempting chemical trip to oblivion, the fight to survive on his own terms, for reasons close to his own heart. \"", "https://www.amazon.sg/Million-Little-Pieces-James-Frey/dp/0307276902/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JkwVwh_Det7RAG0T_HUiw4YAdcPIPU1SzadwE-B_Q6c1AmW4H6byxRurXqqmTOGc_UzUl07SCrVLGnGCtMDEjk5dlLVSr3ioc832CtyFeIrz2dEnli2XMPx_jpXYNfVO9XI2NHjK8Rscu9bFiZ6fIchMiReIRP5JUhDAaWKDjqBKIFosQ3by5-YY1iS_J9nmE-iDTGUKv-JYlD-Sdlm2ebK6LSIRVE34uYYwIoHcU_Ncq1IyN6UE-QP1Ujbsvr3NeYx0yIerv02Kej-i9w-P0RTZmfxDEJJemVbNsKDRcL8.upq_oxXsGUgQ9DqW80VqS7SXe4uamjtfHFPH25pL9Jk&dib_tag=se&keywords=A+Million+Little+Pieces+book&qid=1713334417&sr=8-1", 383),

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts--Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak--that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, impeccably researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.

Especially relevant in today\'s world, this is a beautifully written book that will make you think. And, more importantly, it will make you feel.\"  -- Garth Stein, New York Times bestselling author of The Art of Racing in the Rain “Jamie Ford\'s first novel explores the age-old conflicts between father and son, the beauty and sadness of what happened to Japanese Americans in the Seattle area during World War II, and the depths and longing of deep-heart love. An impressive, bitter, and sweet debut.” -- Lisa See, bestselling author of Snow Flower and the Secret Fan  In the opening pages of Jamie Ford’s stunning debut novel, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, Henry Lee comes upon a crowd gathered outside the Panama Hotel, once the gateway to Seattle’s Japantown. It has been boarded up for decades, but now the new owner has made an incredible discovery: the belongings of Japanese families, left when they were rounded up and sent to internment camps during World War II. As Henry looks on, the owner opens a Japanese parasol. This simple act takes old Henry Lee back to the 1940s, at the height of the war, when young Henry’s world is a jumble of confusion and excitement, and to his father, who is obsessed with the war in China and having Henry grow up American. While “scholarshipping” at the exclusive Rainier Elementary, where the white kids ignore him, Henry meets Keiko Okabe, a young Japanese American student. Amid the chaos of blackouts, curfews, and FBI raids, Henry and Keiko forge a bond of friendship–and innocent love–that transcends the long-standing prejudices of their Old World ancestors. And after Keiko and her family are swept up in the evacuations to the internment camps, she and Henry are left only with the hope that the war will end, and that their promise to each other will be kept. Forty years later, Henry Lee is certain that the parasol belonged to Keiko. In the hotel’s dark dusty basement he begins looking for signs of the Okabe family’s belongings and for a long-lost object whose value he cannot begin to measure. Now a widower, Henry is still trying to find his voice–words that might explain the actions of his nationalistic father; words that might bridge the gap between him and his modern, Chinese American son; words that might help him confront the choices he made many years ago.  Set during one of the most conflicted and volatile times in American history, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet is an extraordinary story of commitment and enduring hope. In Henry and Keiko, Jamie Ford has created an unforgettable duo whose story teaches us of the power of forgiveness and the human heart.BONUS: This edition contains a Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet discussion guide and an excerpt from Jamie Ford\'s Love and Other Consolation Prizes.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Hotel-Corner-Bitter-Sweet-Jamie/dp/0345505344/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ydRGEl77M_NX510i_WcjPyJyfDZpQlezF21oL6T8_oUBCMWw59TkdzR54ILzffvW3YhJkW0k6lbkS0rr-ULcAw6uNm-vD01RaQFry0QsL2kZDSdRJJ6uDJhZ0Uwgpfo1HC0SK8PVvQB4dp9gfLGw78eCd1tE7iB-_dfUQSj8bjp8P8oO3kIv6ECDo0uVK9ca75-4q1Dr1fMGOqe5sKmhIef05JaXXBNHdpzHcJLqRixEdD9pIBSKwWY9tSTlCDoKKFYO4zzUH-YRAr5owvmpe6s-ygRVhHAreOCibt39OAE.I6HBu9MeCF_CJD5VajOP79STyH1PUrxdFYjBTS4Il7M&dib_tag=se&keywords=Hotel+on+the+Corner+of+Bitter+and+Sweet+book&qid=1713334541&sr=8-1", 396),

For Andy Barber, a man with an iron will and a dark secret, it is a test of guilt and innocence in the deepest sense.How far would you go?Praise for Defending Jacob“A novel like this comes along maybe once a decade . . . a tour de force, a full-blooded legal thriller about a murder trial and the way it shatters a family. With its relentless suspense, its mesmerizing prose, and a shocking twist at the end, it’s every bit as good as Scott Turow’s great Presumed Innocent. But it’s also something more: an indelible domestic drama that calls to mind Ordinary People and We Need to Talk About Kevin. A spellbinding and unforgettable literary crime novel.”—Joseph Finder“Defending Jacob is smart, sophisticated, and suspenseful—capturing both the complexity and stunning fragility of family life.”—Lee Child“Powerful . . . leaves you gasping breathlessly at each shocking revelation.”—Lisa Gardner“Disturbing, complex, and gripping, Defending Jacob is impossible to put down.

In this \"artful, informative, and delightful\" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, a classic of our time, evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond dismantles racist theories of human history by revealing the environmental factors actually responsible for its broadest patterns.The story begins 13,000 years ago, when Stone Age hunter-gatherers constituted the entire human population. Around that time, the developmental paths of human societies on different continents began to diverge greatly. Early domestication of wild plants and animals in the Fertile Crescent, China, Mesoamerica, the Andes, and other areas gave peoples of those regions a head start at a new way of life. But the localized origins of farming and herding proved to be only part of the explanation for their differing fates. The unequal rates at which food production spread from those initial centers were influenced by other features of climate and geography, including the disparate sizes, locations, and even shapes of the continents. Only societies that moved away from the hunter-gatherer stage went on to develop writing, technology, government, and organized religions as well as deadly germs and potent weapons of war. It was those societies, adventuring on sea and land, that invaded others, decimating native inhabitants through slaughter and the spread of disease.A major landmark in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way in which the modern world, and its inequalities, came to be.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393354326/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.GQUpCoscdUO8yljPdEqDg_2mk_T59YjU7XxyLOoERfVMHWcKJ9uhZi1ujml0NgItPa5yVkv0jzZMBX0f0pg1098G4fB_fCgLUi0kToZAgrGj_JAqPcK21aWtb_Ay1JzvbyItUlTHeKSSRiRe8dye8s57lgRETJMkF1IvNvjeIyVfHFvzZaxlpg6tCQb14d1GXMAwhKaXmwKuDuF564CV-_atMyutxR6jSdVYeDeHCiXtecsvCKBMGmAXgSUau2D2rHb4Dl1bSu3GEgV1znVM0XLVDwY0XdLvKAaEBMfnPh8.E3AtDiFGXxPaIkAM-66iKb0GLsL3eXTkSCeL7xSoj_4&dib_tag=se&keywords=Guns%2C+Germs%2C+and+Steel%3A+The+Fates+of+Human+Societies+book&qid=1713334629&sr=8-1", 408),

Patch está empezando a alejarse y Nora no sabe si es por su bien o porque cada vez está más interesado en su archienemiga Marcie Millar. Además, una serie de imágenes sobre su padre la acosan de manera recurrente. A medida que Nora se sumerge en el misterio de su muerte, comienza a sospechar que su sangre nefilim puede estar relacionada con el asunto. Pero Patch no le da ninguna respuesta, por lo que ella decide investigar por su cuenta, arriesgándose hasta el límite.  ¿Qué verdad se esconde detrás de la muerte de su padre? ¿Puede contar con Patch o este le oculta secretos más oscuros de lo que ella imagina?ENGLISH DESCRIPTIONThe sequel to the New York Times bestselling phenomenon, Hush, Hush!Nora should have know her life was far from perfect. Despite starting a relationship with her guardian angel, Patch (who, title aside, can be described anything but angelic), and surviving an attempt on her life, things are not looking up. Patch is starting to pull away and Nora can\'t figure out if it\'s for her best interest or if his interest has shifted to her arch-enemy Marcie Millar. Not to mention that Nora is haunted by images of her father and she becomes obsessed with finding out what really happened to him that night he left for Portland and never came home. The farther Nora delves into the mystery of her father\'s death, the more she comes to question if her Nephilim blood line has something to do with it as well as why she seems to be in danger more than the average girl. Since Patch isn\'t answering her questions and seems to be standing in her way, she has to start finding the answers on her own. Relying too heavily on the fact that she has a guardian angel puts Nora at risk again and again. But can she really count on Patch or is he hiding secrets darker than she can even imagine?", "https://www.amazon.sg/Crescendo-Spanish-2-Becca-Fitzpatrick/dp/8420434248/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bx7tjGdGdjin5AEwhUr0dttVjdOtptYmVJtsZxkazeGaL1ADcFB7ZXpU8kgKLB1mUWWAaP9B83Avcecu-5D9NUAnLD44CxQzJO1AjqcXZB6WC7OXvYxuKvdxzhaICFHBR1KnJ2i5EvQw5Q4JXTFWdKJK1ReGrr_VcI32tUgZQhIdapAbEUEFQBq9dTs3ZNggcJGElWXd57nUyIEOqgWuzNPwm6GzMaCIh2Xpj1_oOcYqvbYYp4EPwpz1KmYqlTuq46NTCsLzrcazj4TjilfsuLjUotev5TPXJff5cuIhxX0.N_0Ru5v18j4WYbWY9SwB1LL2-kz9I_Vu_sjJtx-U77U&dib_tag=se&keywords=Crescendo+book&qid=1713334855&sr=8-1", 434),

The period is the ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men, when the famous forest of Mirkwood was still standing, and the mountains were full of danger. In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way (as he did) -- if you do not already know all about these things -- much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves, and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period. For Mr. Bilbo Baggins visited various notable persons; conversed with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent; and was present, rather unwillingly, at the Battle of the Five Armies. This is all the more remarkable, since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend, perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement. But this account, based on his personal memoirs, of the one exciting year in the otherwise quiet life of Mr. Baggins will give you a fair idea of the estimable people now (it is said) becoming rather rare.

Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.  On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive.

At sixteen, she became a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest nominee ever for the Nobel Peace Prize. I AM MALALA is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for girls\' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.

From the sex-obsessed tyrant in the Old Testament to the more benign Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers, Dawkins rigorously analyzes God in all his forms, eviscerating the major arguments for religion and demonstrating the supreme improbability of a supreme being. His argument steeped in impressive historical and contemporary evidence, spanning from the Crusades to 9/11, Dawkins shows how religion fuels war and foments bigotry, and makes the compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong but potentially deadly.

This first edition credited the work\'s fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, leading many readers to believe he was a real person and the book a travelogue of true incidents. It was published under the considerably longer original title The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver\'d by Pyrates. Epistolary, confessional, and didactic in form, the book is a fictional autobiography of the title character (whose birth name is Robinson Kreutznaer)—a castaway who spends years on a remote tropical island near Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers before being rescued. The story is widely perceived to have been influenced by the life of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on the Pacific island called \"Más a Tierra\" (in 1966 its name was changed to Robinson Crusoe Island), Chile. However, other possible sources have been put forward for the text. It is possible, for example, that Defoe was inspired by the Latin or English translations of Ibn Tufail\'s Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, an earlier novel also set on a desert island. Another source for Defoe\'s novel may have been Robert Knox\'s account of his abduction by the King of Ceylon in 1659 in \"An Historical Account of the Island Ceylon,\" Glasgow: James MacLehose and Sons (Publishers to the University), 1911. In his 2003 book In Search of Robinson Crusoe, Tim Severin contends that the account of Henry Pitman in a short book chronicling his escape from a Caribbean penal colony and subsequent shipwrecking and desert island misadventures, is the inspiration for the story. Arthur Wellesley Secord in his Studies in the narrative method of Defoe (1963: 21-111) painstakingly analyses the composition of Robinson Crusoe and gives a list of possible sources of the story, rejecting the common theory that the story of Selkirk is Defoe\'s only source.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Strange-Surprising-Adventures-Robinson-Mariner/dp/1532915527/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.08Pl3Znxn52btZ4KCHavTsgSn4zg9W8SBws0KKq7vtn63X1nbfld5356F2ng9e33eDEexXi97Y6hDmOkRG0V_U8KU1eu5K9Zy7X-iTCriPTbY7oreY3RN8wr90ek-uHf0q85N_lkVfKA7xg_YZJGUCcTLqEnxZImAdpadLeKSpSsJ6LDfmRu7N6pvmPWkP_uj1kZepa-f16N2k5KpAE3SYbmUGm--DkZZCsoDVSq45KrfHha8_5HKe0BRTOFRpZhbhtW1ATqEaW61K90UKLA_P22UyQZEEFknli3d8HXu_k.YdNkopaNMKCW01ZygWip7ss9TfKUoavfOaNY6TK1lUg&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Life+and+Strange+Surprising+Adventures+of+Robinson+Crusoe+of+York%2C+Mariner+book&qid=1713335227&sr=8-1", 478),

Here’s what really happens during mental and physical performance when we crack under pressure, and here are simple ways not to choke in stressful situations.Why do the smartest students often do poorly on standardized tests?Why did you tank that interview or miss that golf swing when you should have had it in the bag?Why do you mess up when it matters the most—and how can you perform your best instead?It happens to all of us. You’ve prepared for days, weeks, even years for the big day when you will finally show your stuff—in academics, in your career, in sports—but when the big moment arrives, nothing seems to work. You hit the wrong note, drop the ball, get stumped by a simple question. In other words, you choke. It’s not fun to think about, but now there’s good news: This doesn’t have to happen.Dr. Sian Beilock, an expert on performance and brain science, reveals in Choke the astonishing new science of why we all too often blunder when the stakes are high. What happens in our brain and body when we experience the dreaded performance anxiety? And what are we doing differently when everything magically “clicks” into place and the perfect golf swing, tricky test problem, or high-pressure business pitch becomes easy? In an energetic tour of the latest brain science, with surprising insights on every page, Beilock explains the inescapable links between body and mind; reveals the surprising similarities among the ways performers, students, athletes, and business people choke; and shows how to succeed brilliantly when it matters most. In lively prose and accessibly rendered science, Beilock examines how attention and working memory guide human performance, how experience and practice and brain development interact to create our abilities, and how stress affects all these factors. She sheds new light on counterintuitive realities, like why the highest performing people are most susceptible to choking under pressure, why we may learn foreign languages best when we’re not paying attention, why early childhood athletic training can backfire, and how our emotions can make us both smarter and dumber. All these fascinating findings about academic, athletic, and creative intelligence come together in Beilock’s new ideas about performance under pressure—and her secrets to never choking again. Whether you’re at the Olympics, in the boardroom, or taking the SAT, Beilock’s clear, prescriptive guidance shows how to remain cool under pressure—the key to performing well when everything’s on the line.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Choke-Secrets-Brain-Reveal-Getting/dp/1416596186/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.SL1iYh4svAy9ZSs7cYEEyVwpAFr718nKlT5cg1zOrb-7rCFyKd_NbhbollspLpISAIDswWv-lEcqQMdfga0Q0YrdD8YPiRIl7oefMKnvCqVr267fem-YRnp4mZ4Ri45Whfv0Fs_NbeoBLUVaM7JgWkKU1oDMDqMm48ys9_cmVs7_5lyE2fJZuxFJJkfx4y78kBAp1IaPuR9fBskP0ea5eKzx9jF8GoMoYFqoxRjz-OabdpPMauoL57QnkEgNUJ6jRazrXtnvUJ2XEbXRUk5JeAVm-ztWAvZzp2nGBVXvrY4.FpKNk_B6XwBLPkhjocpz4WWR0QsM-7DY7YQE0lrHf6k&dib_tag=se&keywords=Choke+book&qid=1713335282&sr=8-1", 484),

It is a moralistic tale of the life of the horse related in the form of an autobiography, describing the world through the eyes of the creature. In taking this anthropomorphic approach, the author Anna Sewell broke new literary ground and her effective storytelling ability makes it very easy for the reader to accept the premise that a horse is recounting the exploits in the narrative.  The gentle thoroughbred, Black Beauty, is raised with care and is treated well until a vicious groom injures him. The damaged horse is then sold to various masters at whose hands he experiences cruelty and neglect. After many unpleasant episodes, including one where he becomes a painfully overworked cab horse in London, Black Beauty finally canters towards a happy ending. Although Anna Sewell\'s classic is set firmly in the Victorian period, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness.

Millions of Americans work full time, year round, for poverty-level wages. In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that a jobany jobcan be the ticket to a better life. But how does anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich left her home, took the cheapest lodgings she could find, and accepted whatever jobs she was offered. Moving from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, she worked as a waitress, a hotel maid, a cleaning woman, a nursing-home aide, and a Wal-Mart sales clerk. She lived in trailer parks and crumbling residential motels. Very quickly, she discovered that no job is truly \"unskilled,\" that even the lowliest occupations require exhausting mental and muscular effort. She also learned that one job is not enough; you need at least two if you int to live indoors.Nickel and Dimed reveals low-rent America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generositya land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate stratagems for survival. Read it for the smoldering clarity of Ehrenreich\'s perspective and for a rare view of how \"prosperity\" looks from the bottom.

Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise’s homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town, and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past—a journey that can only be guided by one’s own conscience.Written in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of the late Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor, and effortless precision—a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity. Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar\'s niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan\'s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war. The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making. Speak again the ancient oaths: Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination. and return to men the Shards they once bore. The Knights Radiant must stand again.

And Rob begins to think that life with kids, marriage, barbecues, and soft rock CDs might not be so bad.", "https://www.amazon.sg/High-Fidelity-Nick-Hornby/dp/1573225517/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.74bh57MFcAdY4jMcVsi02ZZM4SBkKaR354OsMjgfHGUdWc4Kk-jDbK20l2jFw_Ab3q1IRaTng5MgN3pdFxLie_L-O30zfKAox8DAQyyFpGLGPq7TY21jeP8jBe19w_vo0FR-IJNHBr6cIaOsSPuzmHxDvgsjA--flKHIsSPcjke3s-_C7cZBPZuWZVYdHO_S0Di_Jt1UlYFATxr4TEzSteBY9c11bQPl1PUCgvC8fdOoHBBRRyk1DML-f9-7Z5ERsKM6AM_s_v93z1vLgoihJAD40TDcwUxoXEpP-iKjUd8.M6Heb7RTO6MpWiekmXLZPFIniiO4NuQz4Reqeu7wQgw&dib_tag=se&keywords=High+Fidelity+book&qid=1713337106&sr=8-1", 570),

The killer left no clues. There were no witnesses, no one with a motive. But the police soon came to suspect Quincy Miller, a young Black man who was once a client of Russo’s.  Quincy was tried, convicted, and sent to prison for life. For twenty-two years he languished in prison, maintaining his innocence. But no one was listening. He had no lawyer, no advocate on the outside. In desperation, he writes a letter to Guardian Ministries, a small nonprofit run by Cullen Post, a lawyer who is also an Episcopal minister. Guardian accepts only a few innocence cases at a time. Cullen Post travels the country fighting wrongful convictions and taking on clients forgotten by the system. With Quincy Miller, though, he gets far more than he bargained for. Powerful, ruthless people murdered Keith Russo, and they do not want Quincy Miller exonerated. They killed one lawyer twenty-two years ago, and they will kill another without a second thought.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Guardians-Novel-John-Grisham/dp/052562094X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.E3Crn_j5XdR1jI5nW0ZYX-XjXDv8zqbkSZ2gQIGyNsgFJ4OxXxWOVJ6rolux332IaEKZ9qtvgbskObANavceM391oxerb33dOQVGtGD-H7TuatYof8zFrorvLChp0y0lNdeygDs5_iAtQdQiYFaJjoBPZ6BcohRujy2tID2ZCrzdWlfDePM5LwKLEYGa26TUYqWfsWn-DTC3ybhUpXpjWBOgmu-XFtF09RMaeT6I2lSUps4PCJKl1S22VqUB_ei7s67I03FbR6tFr_VgCrB4j-51r-OlAT2YMLkqYwt3fb0.94whtivSCWFeRcO8Uqy7kt5HbgHRMkWZAau6L9kHpOA&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Guardian+book&qid=1713337115&sr=8-1", 571),

Kiyosaki ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BE7eeKzAL._SY466_.jpg", "April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the personal finance classic Rich Dad Poor Dad that still ranks as the #1 Personal Finance book of all time. And although 25 years have passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published, readers will find that very little in the book itself has changed ― and for good reason. While so much in our world is changing a high speed, the lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad Poor Dad haven’t changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role in our daily lives, the messages in Robert Kiyosaki’s international bestseller are more timely and more important than ever.  Milestones While there is a milestone  to commemorate ― and a new section in the book on Why Milestones Are Important ― preserving the integrity of the original content is testimony to the fact that this book has truly stood the test of time. The sidebars throughout the book (that were updated for the 20-year anniversary edition) have been updated again, but the core principles that parents and grandparents ― those who embraced Robert’s story and messages 25 years ago ― are sharing them with new generations who have found that its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense lessons can be applied to anyone’s life and their vision for a future that includes taking control of their finances.  People of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones. We use them to measure time, mark progress, reflect on the lessons we’ve learned, and celebrate accomplishments… and they give meaning to our life’s journey. They are a way that we integrate past, present, and future… looking back at where we started, where we are today… and the promise of all that the future can hold.  In the quarter century that has passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published ― 25 years since April 8, 1997 ― so many things in our world have changed. But the one thing that has not changed is the pressing need for and the power of financial education. Money is still a mainstay of our lives, like it or not, and technology has brought both speed and innovations to the world of money. In an ever-changing world, we can all still get smarter when it comes to money… and learn as much as we can to secure our future.  Still the One… #1 Today Rich Dad Poor Dad consistently ranks among bestsellers around the world in the categories of Personal Finance, Parenting, and Investing, has been translated into 38 languages, and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert\'s story of growing up with two dads ― his real father and the father of his best friend, his rich dad ― and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.  In many ways, the messages of Rich Dad Poor Dad, messages that were challenged and criticized 25 ago, are more meaningful, relevant, and important today than ever.  Rich Dad Poor Dad... • Explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to become rich • Challenges the belief that your house is an asset • Shows parents why they can\'t rely on the school system to teach their kids about money • Defines once and for all an asset and a liability • Teaches you what to teach your kids about money for their future financial success", "https://www.amazon.sg/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612681131/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.AaJ3BPKStGt1JOzkqMhZr5J9AC0uyLm61VnjNkBAH56X3jMrA8Tj3hURC8kGbQxIOWvUJwU5ynxx3NEfh1YySuS35cIzCsGLNwiyPTsm2pTxNHj9oiVHpXLU-tNXjTGw_p_xQMoTULF1tAE65o6Vtofa1AtNhGRC-XsIfAtVcvoZQH1tyiwCoSpamYvVqpzbZ736AbYSTVb8OXAAZVLrRHdmjGupOZCEglmzSma2BSmeMigiWhVdQrUsGCQTSHAAll9B8NQZbBH4wjP3R9QB3kFxYbxRKdJAa54romfoyxQ.h-gR2IoWASM0eWIEciOTwhWjYPjbjfIfejQTlIK7r_k&dib_tag=se&keywords=Rich+Dad+%2C+Poor+Dad+book&qid=1713337195&sr=8-1", 582),

R. Martin, Junot Díaz, and Erin Morgenstern. The Magicians Quentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A high school math genius, he’s secretly fascinated with a series of children’s fantasy novels set in a magical land called Fillory, and real life is disappointing by comparison. When Quentin is unexpectedly admitted to an elite, secret college of magic, it looks like his wildest dreams may have come true. But his newfound powers lead him down a rabbit hole of hedonism and disillusionment, and ultimately to the dark secret behind the story of Fillory. The land of his childhood fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he ever could have imagined . . .The Magicians is one of the most daring and inventive works of literary fantasy in years. No one who has escaped into the worlds of Narnia and Harry Potter should miss this breathtaking return to the landscape of the imagination.The Magician KingQuentin Coldwater should be happy. He escaped a miserable Brooklyn childhood, matriculated at a secret college for magic, and graduated to discover that Fillory—a fictional utopia—was actually real. But even as a Fillorian king, Quentin finds little peace. His old restlessness returns, and he longs for the thrills a heroic quest can bring.Accompanied by his oldest friend, Julia, Quentin sets off—only to somehow wind up back in the real-world and not in Fillory, as they’d hoped. As the pair struggle to find their way back to their lost kingdom, Quentin is forced to rely on Julia’s illicitly learned sorcery as they face a sinister threat in a world very far from the beloved fantasy novels of their youth.The Magician\'s LandQuentin Coldwater has lost everything. He has been cast out of Fillory, the secret magical world of his childhood dreams that he once ruled. With nothing left to lose he returns to where his story began, the Brakebills Preparatory College of Magic. But he can’t hide from his past, and it’s not long before it comes looking for him. Meanwhile, the magical barriers that keep Fillory safe are failing, and barbarians from the north have invaded. Eliot and Janet, the rulers of Fillory, embark on a final quest to save their beloved world, only to discover a situation far more complex—and far more dire—than anyone had envisioned.Along with Plum, a brilliant young magician with a dark secret of her own, Quentin sets out on a crooked path through a magical demimonde of gray magic and desperate characters. His new life takes him back to old haunts, like Antarctica and the Neitherlands, and old friends he thought were lost forever. The Magician’s Land is an intricate and fantastical thriller, and an epic of love and redemption that brings the Magicians trilogy to a magnificent conclusion, confirming it as one of the great achievements in modern fantasy.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Magicians-Trilogy-Boxed-Set-Magician/dp/0147517389/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oHA4N2_Mn-U6BhsSRPp2QBgS6rfUNCqDXDvNdXfNFS9OWWlZcmk7IffiYQ-CwLJNSJ9CxDhw3VnGu54ulxP9b8NE3ZTDg_AQoau16BtAADnKpRnAEdKtq8ft7HrmSjSsjH-uI0JtK0nI5a4gCzhBU-IG4GNMsDRpYew2w1Pi_WMKX7yXGK-tXwBhy5sR7S1uPprYNZKSG0BpjkFFi69jJ7Aa1EaGtFNzlrRoEt8eA11bqioU01D-KtnlADFPgpGgzhsxP1bX5QfCd6x-tsZIM7l7Nu-AMtmdX0a84yKi4Vs.bv3HVIvH2jLFIMPIXXTVUdZNf6v2FzrNprtRIlLU5uM&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Magicians+book&qid=1713337211&sr=8-1", 584),

Esta edición cuenta con un nuevo prólogo, escrito por Darío Villanueva, director de la Real Academia Española (RAE) y presidente de la Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española (ASALE), especialmente para la ocasión. Se completa con un glosario formado por siete mil palabras, locuciones, frases proverbiales y refranes, explicados según el significado preciso que tienen en el texto cervantino. La primera edición de este Quijote se convirtió en un gran éxito de ventas, sin precedentes en una obra clásica. Más de tres millones de ejemplares, distribuidos en España y América, la convirtieron en la más difundida de la historia. A conseguir su carácter divulgativo y su orientación hacia un público diverso y no especializado, contribuyen especialmente las notas contextualizadoras de la obra, preparadas por Francisco Rico. También se incluyen una serie de estudios complementarios, escritos por algunos de los principales expertos en el gran libro cervantino. Así, Mario Vargas Llosa analiza la modernidad del Quijote en «Una novela para el siglo xxi»; Francisco Ayala reflexiona sobre la construcción de los personajes de la novela en «La invención del Quijote», y Martín de Riquer analiza la obra en el contexto biográfico del autor en «Cervantes y el Quijote». Por su parte, José Manuel Blecua («El Quijote en la historia de la lengua española»), Guillermo Rojo («Cervantes como modelo lingüístico»), José Antonio Pascual («Los registros lingüísticos del Quijote: la distancia irónica de la realidad»), Margit Frenk («Oralidad, escritura, lectura») y Claudio Guillén («Cauces de la novela cervantina: perspectivas y diálogos») abordan distintos aspectos relacionados con la lengua española en la obra cervantina. A todos ellos se une en esta ocasión el actual director de la RAE, Darío Villanueva, que ha querido «aprovechar la oportunidad de oro que me ofrece hoy la nueva salida de esta edición [...] para dar una explicación --mi explicación-- de algunos de los porqués del tan alto reconocimiento que el Quijote ha obtenido desde la fecha de su publicación hasta hoy, así como su palmaria modernidad», antes de recordar que el Quijote fue la obra elegida, en 2002, como la mejor novela de todos los tiempos, por delante de En busca del tiempo perdido, de Proust, y de Guerra y paz, de Tolstoi, en una encuesta realizada por la Asociación de Escritores de Suecia entre cien autores de todo el mundo. ENGLISH DESCRIPTIONNominated as one of America\'s best-loved novels by PBS\'s The Great American ReadTen years ago, the Academies of the Spanish Language conceived of a Don Quixote for everyone. Now, it is being re-released--in a limited edition--to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Cervantes\'s death. 2015 and 2016 bring with them two special Cervantes anniversaries. The celebration of the 400th Anniversary of the Publication of the Second Part of Don Quixote in 2015 will be followed in 2016 by the Commemoration of the 400th Anniversary of Miguel de Cervantes\'s Death. As they did more than a decade ago, the Academies of the Spanish Language and Alfaguara unite for this celebration with a re-edition of the universal classic directed at the whole Spanish-speaking world. This edition boasts a new prologue written specially for the occasion by Darío Villanueva, the director of the Real Academia de la Lengua Española (RAE) (RAE) and president of the Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española (ASALE). It is complemented by a glossary made up of seven thousand words, expressions, phrases and proverbs, each explained according to its precise meaning in Cervantes\'s text. The first edition of this Quixote became a huge sales success, unprecedented for a classic work. More than three million copies, distributed in Spain and the Americas, made it the most widespread in history. The contextualizing notes about the work, prepared by Francisco Rico, contribute to its educational character and its orientation toward a diverse and non-specialized public. It also includes a series of complementary studies, written by some of the primary experts in Cervantes\'s consummate book. As such, Mario Vargas Llosa analyzes the modernity of Don Quixote in \"A Novel for the 21st Century;\" Francisco Ayala reflects upon the construction of the novel\'s characters in \"The Invention of the Quixote;\" and Martín de Riquer analyzes the work in the biographical context of the author in \"Cervantes and Quixote.\" For their part, José Manuel Blecua (\"Don Quixote in the History of the Spanish Language\"), Guillermo Rojo (\"Cervantes as a Linguistic Model\"), José Antonio Pascual (\"The Linguistic Registers of Don Quixote: The Ironic Distance from Reality\"), Margit Frenk (\"Orality, Writing, Reading\"), and Claudio Guillén (\"The Course of Cervantes\'s novel: Perspectives and Dialogues\") deal with different aspects related to the Spanish language in Cervantes\'s work. Joining all this is the current director of the Real Academia de la Lengua Española (RAE), Darío Villanueva, who wants to \"take advantage of the golden opportunity that the release of this new edition offers [...] to give an explanation--my explanation--of some of the reasons for the high recognition that Don Quixote has gained from the date of its publication until today, as well as its clear modernity,\" before reminding us that Don Quixote was the work chosen in 2002 as the best novel of all time, even ahead of In Search of Lost Time by Proust and War and Peace by Tolstoy, in a survey conducted by the Swiss Writers\' Association of 100 authors from around the world.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Don-Quijote-Mancha-Edici%C3%B3n-Quixote/dp/8420412147/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2h69Wqpfc6In2Ff00pgJu5ycSRqx5lg25zNx5RdnRT62-J0yPsfRcUtu4qdOjeXEyVnOMQBfCD73q2qKfcSA0kT6q0OSUajbXThke--x5qq92IPJvYd0pel0I7_qMOHx29yp_96edlW-Dkv2WKAxaB_UZ1NrkjXl0W5Y1X6MH9TbS3MEOyFzOeFeMbJbVttgViBEMNyQuHhOU--bfgCn_OnKskZiS0RxS0OKTMHs42jtu4fLsnCwmZVzmGUoCn_iG9YyAAM4IOqtsX0EMhBxezNwAVHt5Gc4e6mDGBH-y68.-YdOSZb3FfpeisvioQR-__Rp9b8C6bPEfTPpNz_1bb8&dib_tag=se&keywords=Don+Quijote+de+La+Mancha+book&qid=1713337299&sr=8-1", 597),

Named a New York Times Notable Book and a Best Book of the Year by The Economist, Oprah Daily, BookPage, Book Riot, the New York Public Library, and more!In The Song of the Cell, the extraordinary author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Emperor of All Maladies and the #1 New York Times bestseller The Gene \"blends cutting-edge research, impeccable scholarship, intrepid reporting, and gorgeous prose into an encyclopedic study that reads like a literary page-turner\" (Oprah Daily).Mukherjee begins this magnificent story in the late 1600s, when a distinguished English polymath, Robert Hooke, and an eccentric Dutch cloth-merchant, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek looked down their handmade microscopes. What they saw introduced a radical concept that swept through biology and medicine, touching virtually every aspect of the two sciences, and altering both forever. It was the fact that complex living organisms are assemblages of tiny, self-contained, self-regulating units. Our organs, our physiology, our selves--hearts, blood, brains--are built from these compartments. Hooke christened them \"cells.\" The discovery of cells--and the reframing of the human body as a cellular ecosystem--announced the birth of a new kind of medicine based on the therapeutic manipulations of cells. A hip fracture, a cardiac arrest, Alzheimer\'s dementia, AIDS, pneumonia, lung cancer, kidney failure, arthritis, COVID pneumonia--all could be reconceived as the results of cells, or systems of cells, functioning abnormally. And all could be perceived as loci of cellular therapies. Filled with writing so vivid, lucid, and suspenseful that complex science becomes thrilling, The Song of the Cell tells the story of how scientists discovered cells, began to understand them, and are now using that knowledge to create new humans. Told in six parts, and laced with Mukherjee\'s own experience as a researcher, a doctor, and a prolific reader, The Song of the Cell is both panoramic and intimate--a masterpiece on what it means to be human. \"In an account both lyrical and capacious, Mukherjee takes us through an evolution of human understanding: from the seventeenth-century discovery that humans are made up of cells to our cutting-edge technologies for manipulating and deploying cells for therapeutic purposes\" (The New Yorker).", "https://www.amazon.sg/Song-Cell-Exploration-Medicine-Human/dp/1982117362/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9jf89UE0NZLNfyHWdSifMYjW3rHRSv1ptNa0yy-icEEdNzg03H-AnH7jKqGIewZN7GtksrapwQTD2jpBCEEl8VmvDx_gFtv6545q9qq1mOFos0XHpP0O_F_pNL7RiFq0FlckUP5kUKV7TN8Eigyizpo2MPo7FjChlQ_2axB9z2Jmg8BydMSlO9D7-kor48SAAKhOgydxLTZXoewuY6_xA9j-SJCeYJzQNfIOxOmpgYUOlOnASzR2alhCAcAUGL3XlFhNRWZf3UihBwu_NupEFE43HT6jYAQ3VuXQTl-5St4.CMsTxgwdaook_OwpFWeHs2TOUi-Ant_KcDyba7NbmF8&dib_tag=se&keywords=Cell+book&qid=1713337394&sr=8-1", 609),

It was an unlikely quest from the start. With a team composed of the sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the University of Washington’s eight-oar crew team was never expected to defeat the elite teams of the East Coast and Great Britain, yet they did, going on to shock the world by defeating the German team rowing for Adolf Hitler. The emotional heart of the tale lies with Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not only to regain his shattered self-regard but also to find a real place for himself in the world.

Tolkien himself and with the complete text printed in two colors. The Silmarillion fills in the background which lies behind the more popular work, and gives the earlier history of Middle-earth, introducing some of the key characters.The Silmarilli were three perfect jewels, fashioned by Fëanor, most gifted of the Elves, and within them was imprisoned the last Light of the Two Trees of Valinor. But the first Dark Lord, Morgoth, stole the jewels and set them within his iron crown, guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth.The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Fëanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all the heroism, against the great Enemy. It is the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings look back, and in whose events some of them such as Elrond and Galadriel took part.The book also includes several shorter works: the Ainulindalë, a myth of the Creation, and the Valaquenta, in which the nature and powers of each of the gods is described. The Akallabêth recounts the downfall of the great island kingdom of Númenor at the end of the Second Age, and Of the Rings of Power tells of the great events at the end of the Third Age, as narrated in The Lord of the Rings.Tolkien could not publish The Silmarillion in his lifetime, as it grew with him, so he would leave it to his son, Christopher Tolkien, to edit the work from many manuscripts and bring his father\'s great vision to publishable form, so completing the literary achievement of a lifetime. This special edition presents anew this seminal first step towards mapping out the posthumous publishing of Middle-earth, and the beginning of an illustrious forty years and more than twenty books celebrating his father\'s legacy.This definitive new edition includes, by way of an introduction, a letter written by Tolkien in 1951 which provides a brilliant exposition of the earlier Ages, and for the first time in its history is presented with Tolkien\'s own paintings and drawings, which reveal the breathtaking grandeur and beauty of his vision of the First Age of Middle-earth.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Silmarillion-Illustrated-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0063280779/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JkJ_Pc-NQvgDPVCUT9heTUYr4ePw3e71JiUgcAjNUbZVHlXIhU5rYxU4asD4qmtccJtoizWLea_bBXxZiwWLNEZG9XJPXS-K-PASkbKTP593CSV19V9AT8YZheHhxyC86i5h_6My789saOXhdHjvm-tGyE3dWRF-0ihPnFE03SP5yj_p_EE_2cf4LFAWmMgzQkuLMTe-6VWzOpfuH7rWhXrtVLQkLx5Ah2dS3GDGN2s37vXudcHOiOLuTlg5bqmN1zWThMWPzuuLkMwJ2pckDn4dmie-j2bUIVC-DLr6p_M.XEFC94e20iPvY8Nw6KgxbBCms2YAqzpsNb1-xD_ep-c&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Silmarillion+book&qid=1713337410&sr=8-1", 611),

If so, where did you get your information? Social media is full of people claiming that they made a killing on a stock. Just as many people will warn you to stay away from day trading because they lost everything on some \"sure thing\" that went bad in a hurry.So what should you believe? How to Day Trade: The Plain Truth is the first book to talk candidly and in detail about how to become a day trader. It\'s written by me, Ross Cameron, the guy who turned $583 into more than $10 million. Though my results are not typical, they are fully verified and audited. I also have over one million subscribers who tune into my YouTube channel to watch me trade. They see both my winning trades and my losing ones. Yes, even I have days where I lose money. That\'s just the reality, and that\'s what I want to share with you.This book is unique among day trading books in three ways: First, it\'s written by someone with documented success from more than 20,000 trades. Sure there are lots of people on social media calling themselves \"day traders\" who will try to impress you with one amazing trade. Insider tip: You should only be impressed if they offer you an independently audited record of ALL their trades: the winning ones AND the losing ones.Second, of all the books for day traders, this one is unique: I clear away a lot of \"head trash\" that comes from social media, friends, and family who may have opinions but no real facts or deep experience with day trading. It addresses questions and opinions that most people have about day trading, like: \"If it is possible to day trade profitably, why haven\'t the giant trading firms taken it over and monopolized it by this point?\"\"If it\'s possible for regular people to make consistent money by day trading, then why isn\'t everyone doing it?\"\"Day trading is gambling. Nothing more, nothing less.\"\"What role does luck have in day trading?\"\"I have a hard time believing that you will tell me exactly the methods you use to trade. If you did that, wouldn\'t you lose your competitive edge?\"\"I\'m a gamer who\'s incredibly fast with the keyboard. Why can\'t I skip all the concepts and learning, and simply follow you as you trade?\"You will get specific, honest answers to all of these questions and more.The third thing that makes this book unique is I have identified 20 specific \"guardrails\" over my many years of trading. These are rules I follow, plus some I wish I knew when I was starting out. They are incredibly useful to keep in mind during the heat of trading-and it does get hot.If you\'re looking for day trading books for beginners, this is the book to get. Plus if you feel like you\'re not a beginner but your day trading is going nowhere, this could be the book to have in order to get you back on track.As important as charts and financial ratios are, those things come later. If you\'re thinking about day trading for a living, what you need to know first is whether day trading fits your personality, and how to avoid the biggest myths and mistakes that will cost you time and money.Real day trading is not anything like what you see on social media. After you read this book, you\'ll know why. You\'ll also have a solid roadmap of day trading strategies to take, if you decide to explore this amazing profession.", "https://www.amazon.sg/How-Day-Trade-Plain-Truth/dp/B0CM825Z81/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PPHEuQ6vDhTEjdAfO9FopVwSvORhVaCBkjGOdKaHtDE17gstPN6AuP1c_yiZInODVa7_bpVoC2UTB_l4Lk4vU7jzetyEogK1dJ10WdTqpT2oy9OcZApey2L6QojIVvLXhXSnLsLvUvRh3IsZ8O-Zt77BpEDOJXr7run0MjJsXFljcWou5BgC5EKaV9ZweIXpJcWI0HpqiGC-Xs9a9KvZMvlFxNpzMapZIxCm02IM3CJVwUXDF9EBr_rArFpnOvCj0Fw38ZrLJZs1rqCCkurcafi6Xt6b9a97SkJPuVW9mgE.A4HBgGafutpygoeIVPFW-qvwc1vqaWewEV5ndRM6T8g&dib_tag=se&keywords=Plain+Truth+book&qid=1713337445&sr=8-1", 616),

The scientist, Jean-Marc Jancovici, walks us through just about everything: from the innermost workings of our minds to toothbrushes, office jobs, and oil; ancient history and modern geopolitics; economics and ecology; the unfolding climate crisis and its consequences for us all.

Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill\'s thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth.

One phrase in particular anchored itself in listeners\' minds, a reminder that for all the discord and struggle to be found in our history as a nation, we have always been guided by a dogged optimism in the future, or what Obama called \"the audacity of hope.\" The Audacity of Hope is Barack Obama\'s call for a different brand of politics--a politics for those weary of bitter partisanshipand alienated by the \"endless clash of armies\" we see in congress and on the campaign trail; a politics rooted in the faith, inclusiveness, and nobility of spirit at the heart of \"our improbable experiment in democracy.\" He explores those forces--from the fear of losing to the perpetual need to raise money to the power of the media--that can stifle even the best-intentioned politician. He also writes, with surprising intimacy and self-deprecating humor, about settling in as a senator, seeking to balance the demands of public service and family life, and his own deepening religious commitment. At the heart of this book is Barack Obama\'s vision of how we can move beyond our divisions to tackle concrete problems. He examines the growing economic insecurity of American families, the racial and religious tensions within the body politic, and the transnational threats--from terrorism to pandemic--that gather beyond our shores. And he grapples with the role that faith plays in a democracy--where it is vital and where it must never intrude. Underlying his stories is a vigorous search for connection: the foundation for a radically hopeful political consensus. Only by returning to the principles that gave birth to our Constitution, Obama says, can Americans repair a political process that is broken, and restore to working order a government that has fallen dangerously out of touch with millions of ordinary Americans. Those Americans are out there, he writes--\"waiting for Republicans and Democrats to catch up with them.\"", "https://www.amazon.sg/Audacity-Hope-Thoughts-Reclaiming-American/dp/0307237699/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dF8xmTlbS5Q3BIcpsimB-KFDPvqg-A4d8QZLPAMWcvUyoZgQqfXy2Z_zhYuyOkJ0.heuQ9H3EgPg65AchqoSCnRWWmVywn0LX68l_hZObW18&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Audacity+of+Hope%3A+Thoughts+on+Reclaiming+the+American+Dream+book&qid=1713337983&sr=8-1", 690),

Then, to her amazement, the \"coolest girl in the world\" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all--beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer\'s end they\'ve become TullyandKate. Inseparable. So begins Kristin Hannah\'s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives. From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn\'t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she\'ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she\'ll envy her famous best friend. . . . For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship--jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they\'ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test. Firefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone\'s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it\'s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It\'s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you--and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you\'ll never forget . . . one you\'ll want to pass on to your best friend.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Firefly-Lane-Kristin-Hannah/dp/0312537077/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.mGNre6p7tq624ramqrKhtFY_-conpYpbowJFLmmqado4PlmrQgJPVfpd8Ktx9mhJnRxIvzoy9Espjbd-RpV58wyXQcLAxKwkANXll-B7I9jBrfoxM32gAslvxEKrCX7fpgLWJ_xSGTyotsYhXOBmAzOptA_tRe17uHPzvECNgdBLvMDkb9bytE_xnRaKjl0v5XO_TWi9DBJx1ZHKwQDtEeELQeHbVDFgyho4j9M_tOl4lkvl4QB_ghngKwOnQMDGd3DV4bvNF7vUSqRbA0OuMvNd_weGvjFu0gvAtRj1-gg.7oF8RkA99TSKMhjwQhfmgP8hWKM01G1lxr2ZVgq7PI0&dib_tag=se&keywords=Firefly+Lane+book&qid=1713338001&sr=8-1", 692),

Baseado em fatos reais, o romance parte da banalização do amor e do para nos fazer refletir sobre a natureza humana e a liberdade de sermos nós mesmos.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Onze-minutos-Portuguese-Paulo-Coelho/dp/1521035903/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0ksRa1jA3ScZaq13tL9lBAXNb-FY6dGSpatthjAy4EwvNImHAco8iv75jrIfu3yQYGYzJE_T6-3kWa5KImYNIk4avwqoANK3SS_xwxPfg1Cs--8VhKN5r9raTs4he0e0BNfyx9tJwkus7UcP1nNN9QtPKscW7Dicok3-sL4f2PNn5oJ4JL_JdFgIS-RRoz_J3nLYSOKBmpCKS7Q6BP3DxGItdzDPCRPIZ6SNseXZg0AOfH81O7htPghT3Y8Sp3khKFYO4zzUH-YRAr5owvmpe8l9PIRMPM4c5u2wkOyxW_4.9MYsR83oK1A1AcvL5kZmMQIZkh-tJqNhUfEhW1H_a0M&dib_tag=se&keywords=Onze+minutos+book&qid=1713338151&sr=8-1", 708),

A literary phenomenon soon after its release, it spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by the shockingly true story of a child’s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty\'s iconic novel focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. When sweet Regan\'s behavior turns sinister, a small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals take it upon themselves to rescue the poor girl from her unspeakable fate. Timeless and terrifying, The Exorcist is a story that has gripped the public zeitgeist for nearly half a century.Soon after its publication, The Exorcist became a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On the opening day of the film, lines of fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events, and CBS’s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark of American culture. . .and a reflection of our innermost fears.Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist continues to engross and disturb readers.

Next is “Apt Pupil,” the inspiration for the film of the same name about top high school student Todd Bowden and his obsession with the dark and deadly past of an older man in town.  In “The Body,” four rambunctious young boys plunge through the façade of a small town and come face-to-face with life, death, and intimations of their own mortality. This novella became the movie Stand By Me.

By age six, Lily was helping her father break horses. At fifteen, she left home to teach in a frontier town—riding five hundred miles on her pony, alone, to get to her job. She learned to drive a car and fly a plane. And, with her husband, Jim, she ran a vast ranch in Arizona.

Seabiscuit was one of the most electrifying and popular attractions in sports history and the single biggest newsmaker in the world in 1938, receiving more coverage than FDR, Hitler, or Mussolini. But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit’s fortunes: Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire. When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains. Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson. Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically indolent also-ran into an American sports icon.Praise for Seabiscuit “Fascinating . . . Vivid . . . A first-rate piece of storytelling, leaving us not only with a vivid portrait of a horse but a fascinating slice of American history as well.”—The New York Times  “Engrossing . . . Fast-moving . . . More than just a horse’s tale, because the humans who owned, trained, and rode Seabiscuit are equally fascinating. . . .

Dodd becomes America\'s first ambassador to Hitler\'s Nazi Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history. A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the \"New Germany,\" she has one affair after another, including with the suprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance--and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler\'s true character and ruthless ambition. Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Göring and the expectedly charming--yet wholly sinister--Goebbels, In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Garden-Beasts-Terror-American-Hitlers/dp/030740885X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Uv2sM0cdeBo2Do4c26vYfAkyzO9Izh55AjB8_y9C_8Y._iLJmAB7Wokwtl9mFHKJQh8EOfuJUOcReHxalZ9TSvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=In+the+Garden+of+Beasts%3A+Love%2C+Terror%2C+and+an+American+Family+in+Hitler%27s+Berlin+book&qid=1713338665&sr=8-1", 771),

How else to explain the chance encounter that threw them together, allowing both to blossom? Quirky and spellbinding.” -- People It was the summer Coltrane died, the summer of love and riots, and the summer when a chance encounter in Brooklyn led two young people on a path of art, devotion, and initiation. Patti Smith would evolve as a poet and performer, and Robert Mapplethorpe would direct his highly provocative style toward photography. Bound in innocence and enthusiasm, they traversed the city from Coney Island to Forty-Second Street, and eventually to the celebrated round table of Max’s Kansas City, where the Andy Warhol contingent held court. In 1969, the pair set up camp at the Hotel Chelsea and soon entered a community of the famous and infamous, the influential artists of the day and the colorful fringe. It was a time of heightened awareness, when the worlds of poetry, rock and roll, art, and sexual politics were colliding and exploding. In this milieu, two kids made a pact to take care of each other. Scrappy, romantic, committed to create, and fueled by their mutual dreams and drives, they would prod and provide for one another during the hungry years.Just Kids begins as a love story and ends as an elegy. It serves as a salute to New York City during the late sixties and seventies and to its rich and poor, its hustlers and hellions.

He hits bottom after discovering his only daughter has shut him out of her wedding. And he decides to take his own life.  He makes a midnight ride to his small hometown, with plans to do himself in. But upon failing even to do that, he staggers back to his old house, only to make an astonishing discovery. His mother--who died eight years earlier--is still living there, and welcomes him home as if nothing ever happened.  What follows is the one \"ordinary\" day so many of us yearn for, a chance to make good with a lost parent, to explain the family secrets, and to seek forgiveness. Somewhere between this life and the next, Charley learns the astonishing things he never knew about his mother and her sacrifices.

Here they successfully tackle the big questions . . . for even younger kids. -- The Horn Book (starred review)Young children are curious about almost everything, especially their bodies. And young children are not afraid to ask questions. What makes me a girl? What makes me a boy? Why are some parts of girls\' and boys\' bodies the same and why are some parts different? How was I made? Where do babies come from? Is it true that a stork brings babies to mommies and daddies? It\'s Not the Stork! helps answer these endless and perfectly normal questions that preschool, kindergarten, and early elementary school children ask about how they began. Through lively, comfortable language and sensitive, engaging artwork, Robie H. Harris and Michael Emberley address readers in a reassuring way, mindful of a child\'s healthy desire for straightforward information. Two irresistible cartoon characters, a curious bird and a squeamish bee, provide comic relief and give voice to the full range of emotions and reactions children may experience while learning about their amazing bodies. Vetted and approved by science, health, and child development experts, the information is up-to-date, age-appropriate, and scientifically accurate, and always aimed at helping kids feel proud, knowledgeable, and comfortable about their own bodies, about how they were born, and about the family they are part of.Back matter includes an index.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Its-Not-Stork-Families-Friends/dp/0763633313/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.GPoDeIjUwFsqv6KPgm0_g6AIeFLf-nRlyxxLb1cvnEfH1gMoqRj3bptIJ7I8taCxF8cS3mlAzJ7h7qAkrQ43IGLX1lZzJNkn_jmXAy6UpYbgbvxR2tI1yVjm-pz7ZPDUEPXuEvRriGIQyWnnBb2QQh5-QSPPRM8z4Q5cp_LeMS6X3rWC3w7U3F3G5QSJ_WsIR_qNqVxWfqVrMCgu3neY4uMt91ga_1e94YFuVekn1Ls_eqIIdTKv9tLfIZn0h_5eluJmiOOxOMcom6nuas1GmzUn2Psc3ZgC40nabvER6aQ.Y37eJUiOZsYvysJxKNnj_VoKK3wC0P3ZwKnCxU4ZOO0&dib_tag=se&keywords=About+a+Boy+book&qid=1713338867&sr=8-1", 795),

I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.\" —Henry David ThoreauWalden (first published in 1854 as Walden; or, Life in the Woods) is a book by American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau. The text is a reflection upon the author\'s simple living in natural surroundings. The work is part personal declaration of independence, social experiment, voyage of spiritual discovery, satire, and—to some degree—a manual for self-reliance.Walden details Thoreau\'s experiences over the course of two years, two months, and two days in a cabin he built near Walden Pond amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, near Concord, Massachusetts.Thoreau makes precise scientific observations of nature as well as metaphorical and poetic uses of natural phenomena. He identifies many plants and animals by both their popular and scientific names, records in detail the color and clarity of different bodies of water, precisely dates and describes the freezing and thawing of the pond, and recounts his experiments to measure the depth and shape of the bottom of the supposedly \"bottomless\" Walden Pond.Henry David Thoreau (July 12, 1817 – May 6, 1862) was an American naturalist, essayist, poet, and philosopher.

Thanks to the financial security and material comforts provided by their father’s prosperous rickshaw business, twenty-one-year-old Pearl Chin and her younger sister, May, are having the time of their lives. Though both sisters wave off authority and tradition, they couldn’t be more different: Pearl is a Dragon sign, strong and stubborn, while May is a true Sheep, adorable and placid. Both are beautiful, modern, and carefree . . . until the day their father tells them that he has gambled away their wealth and that in order to repay his debts he must sell the girls as wives to suitors who have traveled from California to find Chinese brides. As Japanese bombs fall on their beloved city, Pearl and May set out on the journey of a lifetime, one that will take them through the Chinese countryside, in and out of the clutch of brutal soldiers, and across the Pacific to the shores of America. In Los Angeles they begin a fresh chapter, trying to find love with the strangers they have married, brushing against the seduction of Hollywood, and striving to embrace American life even as they fight against discrimination, brave Communist witch hunts, and find themselves hemmed in by Chinatown’s old ways and rules.  At its heart, Shanghai Girls is a story of sisters: Pearl and May are inseparable best friends who share hopes, dreams, and a deep connection, but like sisters everywhere they also harbor petty jealousies and rivalries. They love each other, but each knows exactly where to drive the knife to hurt the other the most. Along the way they face terrible sacrifices, make impossible choices, and confront a devastating, life-changing secret, but through it all the two heroines of this astounding new novel hold fast to who they are: Shanghai girls.Praise for Shanghai Girls“A buoyant and lustrous paean to the bonds of sisterhood.”—Booklist“A rich work . . . as compulsively readable as it is an enlightening journey.”—Denver Post", "https://www.amazon.sg/Shanghai-Girls-Novel-Lisa-See/dp/0812980530/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dg3ZYrSuTdBTpY9Hk1MV11h9v6pDpBIT8_NhGco5Verz3WAy4tCMEUGDCv_piBMHPpatlQP66oxDGZhoJqusx3pWxBANpOGnA_2CNUTX2If00e4L3CRLi7x1NuETv3Y57jlTTcSKMPMZVM-7Z5u1PXeATaXCuib5st3t_E2_mfHugJWoiUiMidq_lt1y_8bggBbDJ6_MoMkpLbjnXjgjRQvo8skVSNGBhqD1Oz_gQ74JrNxq8vIFOkz4qY-ZJdNftqgr0-rFrcuJO4U3hWWNnWWCjOTG-wpw7c2JldlK_d8.K1MLxbXnI8jK49_J7Kw-CFMGdoZweFmY3_UbHNmXPfM&dib_tag=se&keywords=Shanghai+Girls+book&qid=1713339102&sr=8-1", 825),

Satrapi evokes herself and her schoolmates coming of age in a world of protests and disappearances.... A stark, shocking impact.” —The New York Times: \"The 50 Best Memoirs of the Past 50 Years\"In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the coming-of-age story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah’s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran’s last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country.Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane’s child’s-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, with laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Persepolis-Story-Childhood-Marjane-Satrapi/dp/037571457X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wxlF-a_sujIpqm_vp8M1Lc_98wQ45nufHUla_MSiHkijbUQmJ7zjM0YDuYf0DXQKeTfsY4MQj3e9z5_3XvrZ7hAk2NIutZmuWp0V4_Zmgbr-J7llSQrUsqX1XgLRpdz7iGIwJ7RZ1B0VUA61I4XHLocZgGfyQjspgxO1ejH6NgiDQ8UeG74siCXL79oCZTRYUU9-9XOFxPNT3bBJZEiTFLGWVFR_BXJbuIoFDtHdSjAZPxanO2dk9Ky3tvVFudiw_UBlYW9G2CIOKIED0SNo2_zBomdyZyD_IBOZ1MwVRRg.T2n3W047SHQFxuHS7BRo9AbJ8aqrusVbyVwMKWvzGaE&dib_tag=se&keywords=Persepolis+book&qid=1713339127&sr=8-1", 828),

To win Portia, Bassanio must pass a test prescribed by her father’s will, choosing correctly among three caskets or chests. If he fails, he may never marry at all. Bassanio and Portia also face a magnificent villain, the moneylender Shylock. In creating Shylock, Shakespeare seems to have shared in a widespread prejudice against Jews. Shylock would have been regarded as a villain because he was a Jew. Yet he gives such powerful expression to his alienation due to the hatred around him that, in many productions, he emerges as the hero. Portia is most remembered for her disguise as a lawyer, Balthazar, especially the speech in which she urges Shylock to show mercy that “droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven.” The authoritative edition of The Merchant of Venice from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes: -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books -An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading Essay by Alexander Leggatt The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

Trying to hold on to the evaporating past, she begins to write down all that she can remember of her life as a girl in China. Meanwhile, her daughter Ruth, a ghostwriter for authors of self-help books, is losing the ability to speak up for herself in front of the man she lives with. LuLing can only look on, helpless: her prickly relationship with her daughter does not make it easy to discuss such matters. In turn, Ruth has begun to suspect that something is wrong with her mother: she says so many confusing and contradictory things.Ruth decides to move in with her ailing mother, and while tending to her discovers the story LuLing wrote in Chinese, of her tumultuous life growing up in a remote mountain village known as Immortal Heart. LuLing tells of the secrets passed along by her mute nursemaid, Precious Auntie; of a cave where dragon bones are mined and where Peking Man was discovered; of the crumbling ravine known as the End of the World, where Precious Auntie\'s bones lie, and of the curse that LuLing believes she released through betrayal. Like layers of sediment being removed, each page unfolds into an even greater mystery: Who was Precious Auntie, whose suicide changed the path of LuLing\'s life?Set in contemporary San Francisco and pre-war China, ‘The Bonesetter’s Daughter’ is an excavation of the human spirit.

Raised by a single mom and constantly moving from place to place, Deryck was used to being the new kid, starting fights (or finishing them), and finding friends who shared his sensibility for chaotic fun and loud music. Sum 41 was born of a group of friends who loved to jam, shared a DIY ethos, and were determined to be rock stars one day. Walking Disaster is Deryck\'s story, but it is also the untold story of Sum 41. Deryck takes you backstage, into the recording booth, and through the highest highs and lowest lows of the band whose story is inextricably woven with his own. With his insightful, earnest, and genuine voice, Deryck gets real about fame, fortune, and the music industry. From winning at the MTV Video Music Awards, being nominated for a Grammy, his high-profile relationships and friendships, contending with invasive paparazzi, and suffering from health issues that brought him to the brink, Deryck offers a forthright and unforgettable memoir.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Walking-Disaster-Life-Through-Heaven/dp/166804501X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zhB4JxC5CxzzNMSf99PuwdG7C1vZfP8sSYLAtAUJ9p1DLMdeuCRm3Z-8kfKUVQBCe2cjD-d3hOJwo06jhK5HFIQWl7rjIZHKNo5I2mGwpds05riYO_aw57rWNC__09bWYw6uYf2xCGplhXrpLD9VEE1LjJB5uDPAvfxPRMDwd3-VkyOOknRphbazYjAnCNK3WkpMhLStLYB14FO2nh-epB2ywxBSp-5hj-zYid6UhvJVwUXDF9EBr_rArFpnOvCj0Fw38ZrLJZs1rqCCkurcafi6Xt6b9a97SkJPuVW9mgE.co5Jupj4JRR0L9VT5k-fn8BiUduvhTuPPMjDupDjZHk&dib_tag=se&keywords=Walking+Disaster+book&qid=1713339382&sr=8-1", 861),

Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl. The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin\'s master has much deeper motives. Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined. Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable.

Winner of the prestigious Lincoln Prize and the inspiration for the Oscar Award winning–film Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis, directed by Steven Spielberg, and written by Tony Kushner.On May 18, 1860, William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry.  Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires.  It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.  We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.  This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln\'s mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation\'s history.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Team-Rivals-Political-Abraham-Lincoln/dp/0743270754/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hvfWVnrPRxEgkkNiDM9oABRqP3G5zVR97JjKb7Kq2LFa334QvND8kYfAOU49US4jN0c8qW69E-9nTSM-SBISRC7wQbhM8q2UiTDnC2Exilalisim3b2XS5LjR8Q0yULfCOZdh19oyU8xVnN9Gk9xUcnLwSOziIHXH3dV7Ps4hwjwX9mGUlF7hSt5dQFWnPJP68-aL_1f_dhvf0z7gynBw-HdbeavGswJKYml4FHLwFoKYBbsgOy1CKr1DTK9JHd5ohccsAXIv9Ss5rcNp0E1qbu6yupZxdR0fxue9sbeG-g.oAdFbZ5dzTP6QYykHibQclklpTP5MaIRErED_EhmTc8&dib_tag=se&keywords=Team+of+Rivals%3A+The+Political+Genius+of+Abraham+Lincoln+book&qid=1713339450&sr=8-1", 870),

Within weeks, she would be transformed into someone unrecognizable, descending into a state of acute psychosis, undergoing rages and convulsions, hallucinating that her father had murdered his wife; that she could control time with her mind. Everything she had taken for granted about her life, and who she was, was wiped out.This is Susannah\'s story of her terrifying descent into madness and the desperate hunt for a diagnosis, as, after dozens of tests and scans, baffled doctors concluded she should be confined in a psychiatric ward. It is also the story of how one brilliant man, Syria-born Dr Najar, finally proved - using a simple pen and paper - that Susannah\'s psychotic behaviour was caused by a rare autoimmune disease attacking her brain. His diagnosis of this little-known condition, thought to have been the real cause of devil-possessions through history, saved her life, and possibly the lives of many others. Cahalan takes readers inside this newly-discovered disease through the progress of her own harrowing journey, piecing it together using memories, journals, hospital videos and records. Written with passionate honesty and intelligence, Brain on Fire is a searingly personal yet universal book, which asks what happens when your identity is suddenly destroyed, and how you get it back.\'With eagle-eye precision and brutal honesty, Susannah Cahalan turns her journalistic gaze on herself as she bravely looks back on one of the most harrowing and unimaginable experiences one could ever face: the loss of mind, body and self ... a mesmerizing story\', Mira Bartók, New York Times bestselling author of The Memory PalaceSusannah Cahalan is a reporter on the New York Post, and the recipient of the 2010 Silurian Award of Excellence in Journalism for Feature Writing.

David\'s victory was improbable and miraculous. He shouldn\'t have won. Or should he have? In David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwellchallenges how we think about obstacles and disadvantages, offering a new interpretation of what it means to be discriminated against, or cope with a disability, or lose a parent, or attend a mediocre school, or suffer from any number of other apparent setbacks. Gladwell begins with the real story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago. From there, David and Goliath examines Northern Ireland\'s Troubles, the minds of cancer researchers and civil rights leaders, murder and the high costs of revenge, and the dynamics of successful and unsuccessful classrooms--all to demonstrate how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity. In the tradition of Gladwell\'s previous bestsellers--The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers and What the Dog Saw--David and Goliath draws upon history, psychology, and powerful storytelling to reshape the way we think of the world around us.", "https://www.amazon.sg/David-Goliath-Underdogs-Misfits-Battling/dp/0316204374/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g8H5-iohMRDjqVz_lgdnd9t_G4y3AYkFJYJyyjFcUVeuGOXj8I7ybFujr__ieLEgLqwyff7t3MReLH_DGlAYDZeP9cRjry-bstDSsX6QUNH2JkcTgB_mmZOBoun8Fodi3K-QyIzQPLJiHOYkhY0OglilQRVcmAO27bvfos2p3_tx6_xzBClAR4DuJpf1rAJQI8JQDQZCT9bQjgA4QS8isadQGt0PcDXdy64Mg5q1Em7MNpEJrDJ0y5vpxN9dFqvyyDUiNpDZoHMk9kSREH4gr0ULk1NgnCJj3sZlVtTWjEY.xlAFte_DKOwpLBRL2qn_MI6UbouMlkVKGyuyKadjmug&dib_tag=se&keywords=David+and+Goliath+book&qid=1713340183&sr=8-1", 892),

She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later—the night before New Year’s Eve—the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John Gregory Dunne suffered a massive and fatal coronary. In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of forty years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LAX, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Center to relieve a massive hematoma.This powerful book is Didion’ s attempt to make sense of the “weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness ... about marriage and children and memory ... about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Year-Magical-Thinking-National-Winner/dp/1400078431/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.NhRjJtCuELvgdAHLRuAoFsQXyYYfAIWZnteJ6SKOvHYmorPb4ykccqbcdKF665iHKsosWgEDIXcIvCOAfwi9mgZKta62wOwe_ooa8AtCQLn5lU_MwBhLz3nPuJ3sdHMJMqbxDA1cpWbqLvKT3k06waCmVKkjUUDt0fiGS8A3QNqiRt-YjbwzjkqMN2-4qCvTXMq4rlwlaXzMopRAwzx7ZMGjErPvZcfSc4GWPj_vw9vuOTrY_NhXNjRI_U4waJMC3rkV8eRdwZfnuZO6s3f-PaYGV11r98VfMT5Az2gDNkk.b4MiCaeFspGCEfji6-9u9XinkpabtSHvaceOdr9qJsQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Year+of+Magical+Thinking+book&qid=1713340203&sr=8-1", 895),

First he visited his wife\'s grave. Then he joined the army. The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce--and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding. Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity\'s resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don\'t want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You\'ll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You\'ll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you\'ll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets. John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine--and what he will become is far stranger.

This luminous new edition continues on that important tradition while seamlessly weaving in modern touches, making it all the more indispensable for generations to come.” —Samin Nosrat, author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat “Cooking shouldn’t just be about making a delicious dish—owning the process and enjoying the experience ought to be just as important as the meal itself. The new Joy of Cooking is a reminder that nothing can compare to gathering around the table for a home cooked meal with the people who matter most.” —Joanna Gaines, author of Magnolia Table In the nearly ninety years since Irma S. Rombauer self-published the first three thousand copies of Joy of Cooking in 1931, it has become the kitchen bible, with more than 20 million copies in print. This new edition of Joy has been thoroughly revised and expanded by Irma’s great-grandson John Becker and his wife, Megan Scott.John and Megan developed more than six hundred new recipes for this edition, tested and tweaked thousands of classic recipes, and updated every section of every chapter to reflect the latest ingredients and techniques available to today’s home cooks. Their strategy for revising this edition was the same one Irma and Marion employed: Vet, research, and improve Joy’s coverage of legacy recipes while introducing new dishes, modern cooking techniques, and comprehensive information on ingredients now available at farmers’ markets and grocery stores. You will find tried-and-true favorites like Banana Bread Cockaigne, Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Southern Corn Bread—all retested and faithfully improved—as well as new favorites like Chana Masala, Beef Rendang, Megan’s Seeded Olive Oil Granola, and Smoked Pork Shoulder. In addition to a thoroughly modernized vegetable chapter, there are many more vegan and vegetarian recipes, including Caramelized Tamarind Tempeh, Crispy Pan-Fried Tofu, Spicy Chickpea Soup, and Roasted Mushroom Burgers. Joy’s baking chapters now include gram weights for accuracy, along with a refreshed lineup of baked goods like Cannelés de Bordeaux, Rustic No-Knead Sourdough, Ciabatta, Chocolate-Walnut Babka, and Chicago-Style Deep-Dish Pizza, as well as gluten-free recipes for pizza dough and yeast breads. A new chapter on streamlined cooking explains how to economize time, money, and ingredients and avoid waste. You will learn how to use a diverse array of ingredients, from amaranth to za’atar. New techniques include low-temperature and sous vide cooking, fermentation, and cooking with both traditional and electric pressure cookers. Barbecuing, smoking, and other outdoor cooking methods are covered in even greater detail. This new edition of Joy is the perfect combination of classic recipes, new dishes, and indispensable reference information for today’s home cooks. Whether it is the only cookbook on your shelf or one of many, Joy is and has been the essential and trusted guide for home cooks for almost a century.

This is the story of Azar Nafisi’s dream and of the nightmare that made it come true. For two years before she left Iran in 1997, Nafisi gathered seven young women at her house every Thursday morning to read and discuss forbidden works of Western literature. They were all former students whom she had taught at university. Some came from conservative and religious families, others were progressive and secular; several had spent time in jail. They were shy and uncomfortable at first, unaccustomed to being asked to speak their minds, but soon they began to open up and to speak more freely, not only about the novels they were reading but also about themselves, their dreams and disappointments. Their stories intertwined with those they were reading—Pride and Prejudice, Washington Square, Daisy Miller and Lolita—their Lolita, as they imagined her in Tehran. Nafisi’s account flashes back to the early days of the revolution, when she first started teaching at the University of Tehran amid the swirl of protests and demonstrations. In those frenetic days, the students took control of the university, expelled faculty members and purged the curriculum. When a radical Islamist in Nafisi’s class questioned her decision to teach The Great Gatsby, which he saw as an immoral work that preached falsehoods of “the Great Satan,” she decided to let him put Gatsby on trial and stood as the sole witness for the defense. Azar Nafisi’s luminous tale offers a fascinating portrait of the Iran-Iraq war viewed from Tehran and gives us a rare glimpse, from the inside, of women’s lives in revolutionary Iran. It is a work of great passion and poetic beauty, written with a startlingly original voice.Praise for Reading Lolita in Tehran“Anyone who has ever belonged to a book group must read this book. Azar Nafisi takes us into the vivid lives of eight women who must meet in secret to explore the forbidden fiction of the West. It is at once a celebration of the power of the novel and a cry of outrage at the reality in which these women are trapped. The ayatollahs don’ t know it, but Nafisi is one of the heroes of the Islamic Republic.”—Geraldine Brooks, author of Nine Parts of Desire", "https://www.amazon.sg/Reading-Lolita-Tehran-Memoir-Books/dp/0812979303/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ieCGqtRgQ3qWCi8cFT2etm8OYMMRTqcmRYkUDPrB97g0GCIvToPPNfY01QUKDuL67ySxiyVfokOpI-ZuZYDopI5EQRksl5nX1PRW302TSzthun3ZArE6dYaiovnfgpmDdoo68XSGqZ9uNtbUvHf1cjjl-uDYC3scVWBHpK5Op2HDmXUPz3xJkbSKcbC-vB0JhjnDa65YEJL8Cj3R2RpzD86HNz3OVpTzUPg2VUqkZ-IZTurQesgkkU3Ub6M9Acy5gTe3iibULb2SSYz2Ue_9hKs-ygRVhHAreOCibt39OAE.VWdfiyFe4w3xH040VadA1RSPfucN0ah7FXevRARbv1k&dib_tag=se&keywords=Reading+Lolita+in+Tehran%3A+A+Memoir+in+Books+book&qid=1713340398&sr=8-1", 916),

An aunt convinces Quoyle and his two emotionally disturbed daughters to return with her to the starkly beautiful coastal landscape of their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Here, on desolate Quoyle’s Point, in a house empty except for a few mementos of the family’s unsavory past, the battered members of three generations try to cobble up new lives. Newfoundland is a country of coast and cove where the mercury rarely rises above seventy degrees, the local culinary delicacy is cod cheeks, and it’s easier to travel by boat and snowmobile than on anything with wheels. In this harsh place of cruel storms, a collapsing fishery, and chronic unemployment, the aunt sets up as a yacht upholsterer in nearby Killick-Claw, and Quoyle finds a job reporting the shipping news for the local weekly, the Gammy Bird (a paper that specializes in sexual-abuse stories and grisly photos of car accidents). As the long winter closes its jaws of ice, each of the Quoyles confronts private demons, reels from catastrophe to minor triumph—in the company of the obsequious Mavis Bangs; Diddy Shovel the strongman; drowned Herald Prowse; cane-twirling Beety; Nutbeem, who steals foreign news from the radio; a demented cousin the aunt refuses to recognize; the much-zippered Alvin Yark; silent Wavey; and old Billy Pretty, with his bag of secrets. By the time of the spring storms Quoyle has learned how to gut cod, to escape from a pickle jar, and to tie a true lover’s knot.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Shipping-News-Annie-Proulx/dp/0671510053/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EkUPnTZO1EHbestW04kXAEfN320WWrKJbwD7RaNJDiJf2Lu58-u--cE07N1co9gwV2FoVOlTdq9lhAaXhhdAFUap03CNyb9ItGzgyMUe1yYagwpERVTF7UzjQAVnOPVBmBTPT4yMExBqz5lp3EOwCgUBtvUohkyelos0tDPfGINhfkRIoUYQvfG-OKFyYPijE8VE-QLJ8_TvF4F5VXBX53itWQmy82LeNqnFo5ttxSOnxSt3_HCTGoznGBGPJmD_vASOW4KallW421xxNoBiwE1fIWfht-uU0pED6f5sqno.AHFul-QvI11epU1D3KkWdf2WtwJ2XSRtPXJD_15Af3k&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Shipping+News+book&qid=1713340434&sr=8-1", 919),

In Not That Kind of Girl,  Dunham illuminates the experiences that are part of making one\'s way in the world: falling in love, feeling alone, being ten pounds overweight despite eating only health food, having to prove yourself in a room full of men twice your age, finding true love, and most of all, having the guts to believe that your story is one that deserves to be told.  \"Take My Virginity (No Really, Take It)\" is the account of Dunham\'s first time, and how her expectations of sex didn\'t quite live up to the actual event (\"No floodgate had been opened, no vault of true womanhood unlocked\"); \"Girls & Jerks\" explores her former attraction to less-than-nice guys--guys who had perfected the \"dynamic of disrespect\" she found so intriguing; \"Is This Even Real?\" is a meditation on her lifelong obsession with death and dying--what she calls her \"genetically predestined morbidity.\" And in \"I Didn\'t F*** Them, but They Yelled at Me,\" she imagines the tell-all she will write when she is eighty and past caring, able to reflect honestly on the sexism and condescension she has encountered in Hollywood, where women are \"treated like the paper thingies that protect glasses in hotel bathrooms--necessary but infinitely disposable.\"  Exuberant, moving, and keenly observed, Not That Kind of Girl is a series of dispatches from the frontlines of the struggle that is growing up. \"I\'m already predicting my future shame at thinking I had anything to offer you,\" Dunham writes. \"But if I can take what I\'ve learned and make one menial job easier for you, or prevent you from having the kind of sex where you feel you must keep your sneakers on in case you want to run away during the act, then every misstep of mine will have been worthwhile.\" Praise for Not That Kind of Girl \"The gifted Ms. Dunham not only writes with observant precision, but also brings a measure of perspective, nostalgia and an older person\'s sort of wisdom to her portrait of her (not all that much) younger self and her world. . . . As acute and heartfelt as it is funny.\"--Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times \"It\'s not Lena Dunham\'s candor that makes me gasp. Rather, it\'s her writing--which is full of surprises where you least expect them. A fine, subversive book.\"--David Sedaris \"This book should be required reading for anyone who thinks they understand the experience of being a young woman in our culture. I thought I knew the author rather well, and I found many (not altogether welcome) surprises.\"--Carroll Dunham \"Witty, illuminating, maddening, bracingly bleak . . .

How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness?The Study: For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?The Standards:Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world\'s greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.The Comparisons: The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good?Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don\'t.The Findings: The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice.

In doing so, it provides an oblique self-portrait of the young Joyce himself. At its center lie questions of origin and source, authority and authorship, and the relationship of an artist to his family, culture, and race. Exuberantly inventive in style, the novel subtly and beautifully orchestrates the patterns of quotation and repetition instrumental in its hero’s quest to create his own character, his own language, life, and art: “to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.” This Penguin Classics edition is the definitive text, authorized by the Joyce estate and collated from all known proofs, manuscripts, and impressions to reflect the author’s original wishes. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

The Gathering Storm, the twelfth novel in Jordan\'s #1 New York Times bestselling epic fantasy series, begins the story\'s dramatic conclusion as Rand al\'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. War is coming. The Dark One\'s forces are brutal and unrelenting. Rand must forge a united front, but the Seanchan remain an immediate threat, as do the Forsaken. With so many shadows swirling around him, Rand is consumed by his responsibilities, turning heartless in the eyes of his allies, and even more merciless to his enemies. Meanwhile the Seanchan march on the White Tower, where Egwene al\'Vere works to rally the disparate factions of the Aes Sedai together, even as their tyrannical leader schemes against her. Providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair, Egwene\'s fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.

Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnets, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator.  Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and -- after his murder -- three more with his protégé. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since.  Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo, Tiepolo, and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way, Cleopatra\'s supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost. In a masterly return to the classical sources, Stacy Schiff here boldly separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order. Rich in detail, epic in scope, Schiff \'s is a luminous, deeply original reconstruction of a dazzling life.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Cleopatra-Life-Stacy-Schiff/dp/0316001945/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Cz_UCmMiZJX7eJ4HxUC-CCHipOeYMoGb5qJx7IKX5iQoizzzfRVVcgCqTMlSEkNlwgw8EERAb1v4KP59EaVYkMsJ90h6An_MbDLL3H7MHR0YidzzUeLrpeAtekAmS6Xne8mmjYoqvdxpHEMBxS_hIitD_nEIDMEqI4aYsid-8wBaWPDMn7cz0PBoQOwDbYe21VA9yTmB8xG-RNXztiYFRrCT0oxjEVOfNquobTlRAS8jLfVM7Nq_x6ZLSZMUuwTFPc8ML8yVy5BYGA3J_3ghJqrIdgGBmb2qAvJ_BwGmnqw.A0FeH4umGv_2sh_Lk-P0_mnCcmVjeekRjA9AJMK3YGU&dib_tag=se&keywords=Cleopatra%3A+A+Life+book&qid=1713340980&sr=8-1", 968),

Friedman ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ch707SpIL._SY466_.jpg", "The beginning of the twenty-first century will be remembered, Friedman argues, not for military conflicts or political events, but for a whole new age of globalization – a ‘flattening’ of the world. The explosion of advanced technologies now means that suddenly knowledge pools and resources have connected all over the planet, levelling the playing field as never before, so that each of us is potentially an equal – and competitor – of the other. The rules of the game have changed forever – but does this ‘death of distance’, which requires us all to run faster in order to stay in the same place, mean the world has got too small and too flat too fast for us to adjust? Friedman brilliantly demystifies the exciting, often bewildering, global scene unfolding before our eyes, one which we sense but barely yet understand. The World is Flat is the most timely and essential update on globalization, its successes and its discontents, powerfully illuminated by a world-class writer. In his new chapters: \'If It\'s Not Happening, It\'s Because You\'re Not Doing It\' and \'What Happens When We All Have Dog\'s Hearing?\' the author explores both the benefits and disadvantages of the very latest developments in global communication. The emergent popularity of blogging, pod-casting, YouTube and MySpace enable the modern world citizen to broadcast their views to a potential audience of billions, and the proliferation of Internet access to even the poorest communities gives everyone who wants to the tools to address issues of social injustice and inequality. On the other hand the technology that seems to improve communication on a global scale causes it to deteriorate on a local scale. Identifying ours as \'The Age of Interruption\', Friedman discusses the annoyance and dangers of BlackBerrys in meeting rooms, hands-free kits in conversation and using a phone or iPod whilst driving. In an age when we are always \'connected\' via email or mobile phone how can we hope to concentrate on one thing without interruption? As expected the author has revitalised this new edition of The World Is Flat with timely insights into the nature of our flat world.", "https://www.amazon.sg/World-Flat-Globalized-Twenty-first-Century/dp/0141034890/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.XO1ibqAZMV6ldDW0l0gGOgBz7nhMZd0EW5E_4VaDXGLSedUaQsjxyOYwTQxpoaXWpSCQyyHZeDxxnTeug61L7Qn6gb4gsUT5dSR3NP3bgv4zhCODbI7TnGSNLw3nu1EunuT8atcA0Zx1kpLIXfqYQpV3UafiJ9XtfoAX2v82RZr-U_k_CtIVT7bFaVbhQxLt.7tJHpcEWLnDRFM3cV8OsmHhhz3G4-i0JE1DN3BzB090&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+World+Is+Flat%3A+A+Brief+History+of+the+Twenty-first+Century+book&qid=1713340991&sr=8-1", 969),

A thin trail of circumstances eventually tied the Tate-LeBianca murders to Charles Manson, a would-be pop singer of small talent living in the desert with his \"family\" of devoted young women and men. What was his hold over them? And what was the motivation behind such savagery? In the public imagination, over time, the case assumed the proportions of myth. The murders marked the end of the sixties and became an immediate symbol of the dark underside of that era.Vincent Bugliosi was the prosecuting attorney in the Manson trial, and this book is his enthralling account of how he built his case from what a defense attorney dismissed as only \"two fingerprints and Vince Bugliosi.\" The meticulous detective work with which the story begins, the prosecutor\'s view of a complex murder trial, the reconstruction of the philosophy Manson inculcated in his fervent followers...these elements make for a true crime classic.

For more than a decade, Jenna Metcalf has never stopped thinking about her mother, Alice, who mysteriously disappeared in the wake of a tragic accident. Refusing to believe she was abandoned, Jenna searches for her mother regularly online and pores over the pages of Alice’s old journals. A scientist who studied grief among elephants, Alice wrote mostly of her research among the animals she loved, yet Jenna hopes the entries will provide a clue to her mother’s whereabouts. Desperate to find the truth, Jenna enlists two unlikely allies in her quest: Serenity Jones, a psychic who rose to fame finding missing persons, only to later doubt her gifts, and Virgil Stanhope, the jaded private detective who’d originally investigated Alice’s case along with the strange, possibly linked death of one of her colleagues. As the three work together to uncover what happened to Alice, they realize that in asking hard questions, they’ll have to face even harder answers. As Jenna’s memories dovetail with the events in her mother’s journals, the story races to a mesmerizing finish.Praise for Leaving Time“Piercing and uplifting . . . a smart, accessible yarn with a suspenseful puzzle at its core.”—The Boston Globe “Poignant . . . an entertaining tale about parental love, friendship, loss.”—The Washington Post “A riveting drama.”—Us Weekly “[A] moving tale.”—People “A fast-paced, surprise-ending mystery.”—USA Today “In Jenna, [Jodi] Picoult has created an unforgettable character who will easily endear herself to each and every reader. . . .

Written when Milton was in his fifties - blind, bitter and briefly in danger of execution - Paradise Lost\'s apparent ambivalence has led to intense debate about whether it manages to \'justify the ways of God to men\' or exposes the cruelty of authority.Edited with an introduction and notes by JOHN LEONARD", "https://www.amazon.sg/Paradise-Lost-John-Milton/dp/0140424393/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hR5Y7ZG5sysQzNv4NTqK4RJepbGDr3SE-mBSBlywirYnSQoDfYN_EkQ1OuEKFLB7YoEf129OSg26AHJlWWmLtfw9aviR_hhATe--Wa7h1FMjIf81jLFM2jYJh9KiEbc2XO5MulIP85Ra1sReyq7Vub3m5sx6_XK2MJQLEPG9jzSvrhdXfBKNuduK-gi9DhcE9bV6dMf8-9774d12CZUID3-dCMvHUeo2F7vPu-WCXOPu0frVgiaI-jA9ANNrlPg6utyu7dgryrbk3e7s8pW6psnQJi3IxNwinGyrwltWxwg.Yb8YwWBsVyTpMR7mr1QBimi052eKtJvEOqwOsQgj9rE&dib_tag=se&keywords=Paradise+Lost+book&qid=1713341112&sr=8-1", 984),

We go for the people who make the food and for the people who serve the food. We eat out to help us feel good feelings about the people we eat with. Restaurants create memories. Every page in Diner captures those feelings.\"--Carla Lalli Music, author of That Sounds So Good and Where Cooking BeginsOn New Year\'s Eve 1998, Andrew Tarlow, along with Mark Firth, opened Diner out of a repurposed dining car under the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn. Within the decade, it single-handedly became one of the city\'s most influential restaurants, giving birth to a Brooklyn mini-empire--including Marlow & Sons, Roman\'s, and Achilles Heel--and an ethos of community, sustainability, and eating local. In Diner: Day for Night, Tarlow takes us back to the restaurant that brought the farm-to-table movement to Brooklyn. Featuring evocative photography, Diner: Day for Night is a poetic homage to a lively place as the day shifts from morning to night, both intimate and welcoming. Get a glimpse of Diner\'s opening chef Caroline\'s first impression of Diner co-founders Andrew and Mark, the chaotic opening night that everyone turned up for, and the many faces that have come and gone throughout the years. The recipes are based upon the food so many have come to love and are built around each season, from Asparagus with Tahini Sauce and Wilted Frilly Mustard Greens and Green Tomatoes with Mozzarella, Basil, and Green Coriander to Lamb Belly with Potatoes and Tomatoes and Vanilla Pots De Crème.

Hapless veterans of World War II, Archie and Samad and their families become agents of England’s irrevocable transformation. A second marriage to Clara Bowden, a beautiful, albeit tooth-challenged, Jamaican half his age, quite literally gives Archie a second lease on life, and produces Irie, a knowing child whose personality doesn’t quite match her name (Jamaican for “no problem”).

You\'ve either done it or know someone who has: the one-night stand, the familiar outcome of a night spent at a bar, sometimes the sole payoff for your friend\'s irritating wedding, or the only relief from a disastrous vacation. Often embarrassing and uncomfortable, occasionally outlandish, but most times just a necessary and irresistible evil, the one-night stand is a social rite as old as sex itself and as common as a bar stool.  Enter Chelsea Handler. Gorgeous, sharp, and anything but shy, Chelsea loves men and lots of them. My Horizontal Life chronicles her romp through the different bedrooms of a variety of suitors, a no-holds-barred account of what can happen between a man and a sometimes very intoxicated, outgoing woman during one night of passion. From her short fling with a Vegas stripper to her even shorter dalliance with a well-endowed little person, from her uncomfortable tryst with a cruise ship performer to her misguided rebound with a man who likes to play leather dress-up, Chelsea recalls the highs and lows of her one-night stands with hilarious honesty.  Encouraged by her motley collection of friends (aka: her partners in crime) but challenged by her family members (who at times find themselves a surprise part of the encounter), Chelsea hits bottom and bounces back, unafraid to share the gritty details.

Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps. The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east. The gods, still suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea\'s army of powerful giants? As dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over. The accessible and dramatic cover art by graphic novelist Nilah Magruder will attract a new generation of fans.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Heroes-Olympus-Book-Five-Blood/dp/1368051707/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JY52o0AQscTWdjp1r-Z6NVOy2WIzZWwuZsJPWxYk5uAOaIc7uWawMqm6gAbniTXzD9kH0hh4d8J7gCbhRd0-lYpSvaCBPf7O09KHoxdYePvo95Niy2bQ9WuB9nKtxnzm8NZU39DSw0JnhfVM2w1MO6Tw_3JPkwP0mQ7Wj2NN6BRi1IykwVOMM16VJMBKTa7WgLrEvbUDRyItq-suiMk61xKNIeEVQI01UEcSi7_Nn-FE4HDwyd3K-BAz22mqA6B7sz8kdW1AAtEzrixlz1mqnMsMy7Yo64fwHdr4AwjJOAI.N3oNQwH8v6R8pJwT3eK3IwQ7wVfBd0VqGlKS9Ul_hfA&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Blood+of+Olympus+book&qid=1713341447&sr=8-1", 1027),

Putting it down.\" --Miami Herald\"Captivating, suspenseful...tantalizing.\" --People MagazineSix responsible adults. Three cute kids. One small dog. It\'s just a normal weekend. What could possibly go wrong?  In Truly Madly Guilty, Liane Moriarty turns her unique, razor-sharp eye towards three seemingly happy families. Sam and Clementine have a wonderful, albeit busy, life: they have two little girls, Sam has just started a new dream job, and Clementine, a cellist, is busy preparing for the audition of a lifetime. If there\'s anything they can count on, it\'s each other. Clementine and Erika are each other\'s oldest friends. A single look between them can convey an entire conversation. But theirs is a complicated relationship, so when Erika mentions a last-minute invitation to a barbecue with her neighbors, Tiffany and Vid, Clementine and Sam don\'t hesitate. Having Tiffany and Vid\'s larger-than-life personalities there will be a welcome respite. Two months later, it won\'t stop raining, and Clementine and Sam can\'t stop asking themselves the question: What if we hadn\'t gone? In Truly Madly Guilty, Liane Moriarty takes on the foundations of our lives: marriage, sex, parenthood, and friendship. She shows how guilt can expose the fault lines in the most seemingly strong relationships, how what we don\'t say can be more powerful than what we do, and how sometimes it is the most innocent of moments that can do the greatest harm.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Truly-Madly-Guilty-Liane-Moriarty/dp/1250069807/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.RgYAX4X6T2GhOVSjPguyuEGITxXTm9khPZIHzAUC5-lWc4gkUPdEnd73-X6HHMfjrJXzX2Am5ezC0BUZT5yvAJu5gGsb42jQz9It_qVpK9alisim3b2XS5LjR8Q0yULfCOZdh19oyU8xVnN9Gk9xUX2Puczj1kcY7kkMZQ4hDGKlt9GnVTgxZlN5QvhF05FDTLpxv31DNtQq-5IZYKl1HMsUqM8DNp13XWUB0PnoHrG0dXjWSoF6H7YXIKBFlQrM9c2oVcTDP9FZvHJE_76QbE1fIWfht-uU0pED6f5sqno.SltlrDz-fdRg2O-mpOm6lYaMJRRbVTZkfDRQLcovtwc&dib_tag=se&keywords=Truly+Madly+Guilty+book&qid=1713341454&sr=8-1", 1028),

We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it’s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time. “Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?” “Should I go out with this girl even though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!” “My girlfriend just got a message from some dude named Nathan. Who’s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be sure?” But the transformation of our romantic lives can’t be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on Reddit, which drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the world’s leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike any social science or humor book we’ve seen before.In Modern Romance, Ansari combines his irreverent humor with cutting-edge social science to give us an unforgettable tour of our new romantic world.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Modern-Romance-Aziz-Ansari/dp/0143109251/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.jDBJV_x8hX36-afUdYnhgfjs2ewWOQPnGqePnVyyzZJsjYWPQMTxlYkRWXeNko_cDb3TnwkIBOIOhzoULqMsudWNPsm_8Q4mUm9hR8t8afQ9HNqkWBHgBK2BAWK1rQoD6F_iJg4jtauKy0OsJytyHRNeWAgPlBKwXAT3yGNOrEuV0iH2O0N2xY2IEsoo9DBK3rFV0jtgPV6jdtnxig4fAuDNEy_82IljLIi7LzLMb_K0cjF5uDrZte6bgLqKEUVqkf98hANF34mUndOqR-58y8-ooqKBAltf-Pqh98hUwpY.ox7_t3EbpvZEGXRy9tR-Y4OmiY27EED--jH52Za2o68&dib_tag=se&keywords=Modern+Romance+book&qid=1713341586&sr=8-1", 1046),

The result is what Michael Pollan calls the American Paradox: The more we worry about nutrition, the less healthy we see to become. With In Defense of Food, Pollan proposes a new (and very old) answer to the question of what we should eat that comes down to seven simple but liberating words: \"Eat food. Not too much.

James McBride, journalist, musician, and son, explores his mother\'s past, as well as his own upbringing and heritage, in a poignant and powerful debut, The Color Of Water: A Black Man\'s Tribute to His White Mother.The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white, James McBride grew up in \"orchestrated chaos\" with his eleven siblings in the poor, all-black projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. \"Mommy,\" a fiercely protective woman with \"dark eyes full of pep and fire,\" herded her brood to Manhattan\'s free cultural events, sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools, demanded good grades, and commanded respect. As a young man, McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment, worry, and confusion—and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain.In The Color of Water, McBride retraces his mother\'s footsteps and, through her searing and spirited voice, recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi, she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1, 1921. Fleeing pogroms, her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk, Virginia, a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high. With candor and immediacy, Ruth describes her parents\' loveless marriage; her fragile, handicapped mother; her cruel, sexually-abusive father; and the rest of the family and life she abandoned.At seventeen, after fleeing Virginia and settling in New York City, Ruth married a black minister and founded the all- black New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in her Red Hook living room. \"God is the color of water,\" Ruth McBride taught her children, firmly convinced that life\'s blessings and life\'s values transcend race. Twice widowed, and continually confronting overwhelming adversity and racism, Ruth\'s determination, drive and discipline saw her dozen children through college—and most through graduate school. At age 65, she herself received a degree in social work from Temple University.Interspersed throughout his mother\'s compelling narrative, McBride shares candid recollections of his own experiences as a mixed-race child of poverty, his flirtations with drugs and violence, and his eventual self- realization and professional success. The Color of Water touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Color-Water-Black-Tribute-Mother/dp/159448192X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.03eMlxFJwIF_ftDkRcbjpgaTwjNzFvCIYMpNEfwKsCs.NMUDBaGjijvjYqaoRJMRiNvjPgWtvmTiW3UMw97AOjs&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Color+of+Water%3A+A+Black+Man%27s+Tribute+to+His+White+Mother+book&qid=1713341783&sr=8-1", 1068),

She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she’s your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks . . . until something extraordinary happens. When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death–a cryptic message on Mac’s cell phone—Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister’s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed—a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae. . . . As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister’s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane—an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women–closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac’s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book—because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands. . . .Look for all of Karen Marie Moning’s sensational Fever novels: DARKFEVER | BLOODFEVER | FAEFEVER | DREAMFEVER | SHADOWFEVER | ICED | BURNED | FEVERBORN | FEVERSONG", "https://www.amazon.sg/Darkfever-Fever-Karen-Marie-Moning/dp/0440240980/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dE907K6Yjg4oaW5X0t_HqrkP677wJyTsKL7982ExxfWGvS1FT8pzXOVuX0fn7YNpldkLhbcL_jxg-waKnW4vU9NxWNYdbhf7N6qvt940YvU5Roizzp3dmkpNIPMzZ-TxYcqeJdUn6aHneUCFcINd4R_3g2oENV_yOfQvi1kTgeypX3URKuI1E8WvYgNmtL7y_0uUOFlD0KDNd5slFeJWwDeLn3oZvTtQ09aZm3gUuiJeyY9KzNCCHyf_uPGGsiDaSIaxlNTZtfVP7pV0QVLDURRNxGZJN313kGsu0azbEak.iXVASYsYwwkz-sD-g8Vx3D-l6pcqn9u2mPsJ1yMol0g&dib_tag=se&keywords=Darkfever+book&qid=1713341827&sr=8-1", 1070),

One day, while tidying up her garden after a storm, she found a chaffinch nest - a strange, sodden lump on the grass under a fir tree. She carried it inside and placed it on a newspaper; over the next few hours, as the water drained out of it, the sodden lump blossomed into a mossy jewel. She was amazed, and dropped everything to make a painting of the nest at exact life size.This was the start of an obsession; Ogilvy has since painted more than fifty bird nests from life, each time marvelling at its ingenious construction. Every species of bird has its own vernacular, but sources its materials - most commonly twigs, roots, grasses, reeds, leaves, moss, lichen, hair, feathers and cobwebs, less usually, mattress stuffing and string - according to local availability. Ogilvy would, of course, never disturb nesting birds; instead she relies upon serendipity, which is why all her nests have either been abandoned after fulfilling their purpose, or displaced by strong winds.Although Nests showcases the specimens she has found near her homes in Somerset and on the Isle of Arran, its subject matter is by no means only British, since these same birds can be found all over Europe, Scandinavia and as far afield as Russia, Turkey and North Africa. This wondrous book is all the more special for its rarity. Few modern books exist specifically on the subject of bird nests; the most recent among the author\'s reference works was published in 1932. Exquisitely designed and packaged, Nests will be an essential addition to the libraries of all nature lovers.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Nests-Susan-Ogilvy/dp/0241481716/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qRnDW35jeiKuunyYm9tAmLfXtL-3f7xfwoZYSLQcwW4Us1XQVetdobPRJo3H0w5DrWOH2CDDcvQnzo0FKNSBYhCD536IYG7lA4cJP3gsR5I_HoJEcdqSAr61XP2wMj4LDWifABzgF52Gi18lJpskrKEXQ0VZ4QUnn5KZsz3hDAdS4bIARRmPaDx0L21NEhsW0O04wDPX1OSBaCwNQKzIRXIO91iJlkHWYNaYgrWsVEqc45hA6I9QpWs_zaJF6DEioyzQvTyWIjHojxgFM5KoWg9GAr7aUOqSiDimAXUVFfc.TQjr13CbRVDcMiyFuuByc9VBJJKLWb2aRi2OmAlbwK4&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Nest+book&qid=1713341886&sr=8-1", 1076),

Lucky Armstrong is a tough, talented grifter who has just pulled off a million-dollar heist with her boyfriend, Cary. She’s ready to start a brand-new life, with a new identity—when things go sideways. Lucky finds herself alone for the first time, navigating the world without the help of either her father or her boyfriend, the two figures from whom she’s learned the art of the scam. When she discovers that a lottery ticket she bought on a whim is worth millions, her elation is tempered by one big problem: cashing in the winning ticket means she’ll be arrested for her crimes. She’ll go to prison, with no chance to redeem her fortune. As Lucky tries to avoid capture and make a future for herself, she must confront her past by reconciling with her father; finding her mother, who abandoned her when she was just a baby; and coming to terms with the man she thought she loved—whose dark past is catching up with her, too. This is a novel about truth, personal redemption, and the complexity of being good.

My mind was warped into a new shape by her prose and it will never be the same again.\" -- Greta GerwigThe authorized, original edition of one of the great literary masterpieces of the twentieth century: a miraculous novel of family, love, war, and mortality, with a foreword from Eudora Welty. From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse, Woolf constructs a remarkable, moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life and conflict between men and women.To the Lighthouse is made up of three powerfully charged visions into the life of the Ramsay family living in a summer house off the rocky coast of Scotland. There\'s the serene and maternal Mrs. Ramsay, the tragic yet absurd Mr. Ramsay, their eight children, and assorted holiday guests. With the lighthouse excursion postponed, Woolf shows the small joys and quiet tragedies of everyday life that seemingly could go on forever.But as time winds its way through their lives, the Ramsays face, alone and together, the greatest of human challenges and its greatest triumph--the human capacity for change.A moving portrait in miniature of family life, To the Lighthouse also has profoundly universal implications, giving language to the silent space that separates people and the space that they transgress to reach each other.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Lighthouse-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0156907399/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.mzCs6hXpxFUg8d7rTLwzmQot6spJRjJhRODXQ2bjpYdYBay0grz1-dWzNAk6_wghgwZSFNSC6HsXVvTJckwP7R1dYw5JBOetXGp4GL3vmzYYf9HjzWrCXSWqEq8OsIq3eV2_NXHIHzlMsFNyjOgZVuZL3hk_FKYEDSXbBK4LPP97vgB7sDOsNDjgKDs2gB7WRTc3ixsXex9NBWy8K0jK-AGwIRJ-2sLPQiUWQHDM2sYQA9fq7HsN8v374skdbJGUw_Ig7H_qcYQtwVq7l5Vx44w7g9OJPMQMhJJFXttyKiE.fQvJWAIY3fYzJLYeE0dvwxaz_V2VxBWbyQol-hDiRTg&dib_tag=se&keywords=To+The+Lighthouse+book&qid=1713341941&sr=8-1", 1084),

Kotter ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61V7IoWlpnL._SY466_.jpg", "Moving beyond the process of changeWhy is change so hard? Because in order to make any transformation successful, you must change more than just the structure and operations of an organizationyou need to change people’s behavior. And that is never easy.The Heart of Change is your guide to helping people think and feel differently in order to meet your shared goals. According to bestselling author and renowned leadership expert John Kotter and coauthor Dan Cohen, this focus on connecting with people’s emotions is what will spark the behavior change and actions that lead to success. Now freshly designed, The Heart of Change is the engaging and essential complement to Kotter’s worldwide bestseller Leading Change.Building off of Kotter’s revolutionary eight-step process, this book vividly illustrates how large-scale change can work. With real-life stories of people in organizations, the authors show how teams and individuals get motivated and activated to overcome obstacles to changeand produce spectacular results. Kotter and Cohen argue that change initiatives often fail because leaders rely too exclusively on data and analysis to get buy-in from their teams instead of creatively showing or doing something that appeals to their emotions and inspires them to spring into action. They call this the see-feel-change dynamic, and it is crucial for the success of any true organizational transformation.Refreshingly clear and eminently practical, The Heart of Change is required reading for anyone facing the challenges inherent in leading change.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Heart-Change-Real-Life-Stories-Organizations/dp/1422187330/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Al6hQMHucelDtLLhnh1zFYaYsU3WOXIc_qSrabzZUFjYFya17Y0F8nUBOZSAgBDHjwOrzlOoXEy5M_zEF5kctWRnZSZ0EgywZBGSovdsBIXhgSO2fD-mLY-RG06qbgoLP7uFWXiVqDRkuAm0trQusBL4XyGQ7yy7r7cBGXjHlI9uN8BeUbMKnwZgkhn-ouLHLLL6DqFNY1vEwHiJmR0e5yCx3YeGjMc_HrePIy6qRdAS-9sPv1XCW9eF2rX7gfMid_EN4f1j3CnJJg1pLo_ft-CJMQFBNwBmBDiHm6tSpx8.ktH3yVlA9srRFsYFTNxkYeT8z-qDJeO_PiBQJclvVmo&dib_tag=se&keywords=Change+of+Heart+book&qid=1713342049&sr=8-1", 1101),

I worshipped Darren Stevens the First. When he\'d come home from work and Samantha would say, \'Darren, would you like me to fix you a drink?\' He\'d always rest his briefcase on the table below the mirror in the foyer, wipe his forehead with a monogrammed handkerchief and say, \'Better make it a double.\'\" (from Chapter Two) You may not know it, but you\'ve met Augusten Burroughs. You\'ve seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twentysomething guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn\'t really a request) of his employers, Augusten lands in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey Jr. are immediately dashed by grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click and that\'s when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life--and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that\'s as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is true. Dry is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a Higher Power.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Dry-Memoir-Augusten-Burroughs/dp/125003440X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.pPwaMLIXIMX9ReiqLWrGJhYUINU5jNv_I9tW98v3sl7oCEmsG7G6nizGF1UKz0wGafcIcOdv43-sTZsrh4IV7Lyim9MjAh6D0yULCqant21jUw2DGi_RA7PoMsQmHmaSxXpvyEgJdX6IKc0ps0v7kb1AyJEhzoPr3YLbbqzkFipvjeZ-vjqgxFSLxibqJLP6_da0pfQJxZwd_czZcmBKQ4KHhpdoQp84S7HR4iraerixHdg0EStP7bNprgFVLG6krZSzwQPr_NeYvDE4wCviV-JBmVnfzUbvtHYkgYINFmA.hyJZgYQ1iFtGccihWApuzmRcHZ0lYqO5xR7xwcdsAus&dib_tag=se&keywords=Dry%3A+A+Memoir+book&qid=1713342059&sr=8-1", 1102),
