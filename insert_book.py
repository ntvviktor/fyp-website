Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun. . . . In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister\'s place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender.

Scott Fitzgerald, The Great GatsbyThe Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, the novel depicts narrator Nick Carraway\'s interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby\'s obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.A youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island\'s North Shore in 1922 inspired the novel. Following a move to the French Riviera, he completed a rough draft in 1924. He submitted the draft to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After his revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book\'s title and considered several alternatives. The final title he desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. Painter Francis Cugat\'s final cover design impressed Fitzgerald who incorporated a visual element from the art into the novel.Gatsby continues to attract popular and scholarly attention. The novel was most recently adapted to film in 2013 by director Baz Luhrmann, while contemporary scholars emphasize the novel\'s treatment of social class, inherited wealth compared to those who are self-made, race, environmentalism, and its cynical attitude towards the American dream. The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary masterpiece and a contender for the title of the Great American Novel.A True Classic that Belongs on Every Bookshelf!", "https://www.amazon.sg/Great-Gatsby-Original-Fitzgerald-Classic/dp/B093MYWTT5/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.BhTVkE9rT2Vd0vVk4-aTzMTEJF3ngPK28_fEbVrtZLaqHCgmZNZeX50vj6v4yvtUYZ5cJRvhXEkRnkbT6QVExdqBSEeXGFZ9t73rg8X0Zuy0BOLhCa3m0kJlv7hJ_wR0o3df-g1O0pUSRoUf5-ghbG4q9IppKGh1esYUiDHIIDxtyRyYhadLY7w5CNvX18PKnEF8-V4LdHHtCy5Y7h7G5M5w5wCVZuumXVHpW9KZlAR7Th5_UtnZ5ZBTK-EWkYrnQ69MF2w9aJYbLnyiubt-MXTmFKUAoCM8xJzwW4N8xWs.WxxHrPqU6Wby4Mq2gvXtJzq_J8uxXgdHFfQFtmjJwbE&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Great+Gatsby+book&qid=1713330806&sr=8-1", 3.89, 2683664, 1925,5),

Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness. Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate—a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister—and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves. My Sister’s Keeper examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child’s life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you?

Charlie is attempting to navigate his way through uncharted territory: the world of first dates and mix-tapes, family dramas and new friends; the world of sex, drugs, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, when all one requires is that perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite. But Charlie can\'t stay on the sideline forever. Standing on the fringes of life offers a unique perspective.

Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, and these ideas remain as relevant and timely as ever. START WITH WHY asks (and answers) the questions: why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won\'t truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it. START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who have had the greatest influence in the world all think, act and communicate the same way—and it\'s the opposite of what everyone else does.

They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it—from garden seeds to Scripture—is calamitously transformed on African soil. What follows is a suspenseful epic of one family’s tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa.The novel is set against one of the most dramatic political chronicles of the twentieth century: the Congo\'s fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of its first elected prime minister, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the insidious progress of a world economic order that robs the fledgling African nation of its autonomy.

Now a Hulu limited series starring Christopher Abbott, George Clooney, Kyle Chandler, and Hugh Laurie.Fifty years after its original publication, Catch-22 remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—books of all time. In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer. Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.

Isaacson’s portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.

Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American ReadA Penguin Classic First published in 1939, Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads—driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.

Suddenly she is a Sassenach—an “outlander”—in a Scotland torn by war and raiding clans in the year of Our Lord . . . 1743. Claire is catapulted into the intrigues of a world that threatens her life, and may shatter her heart. Marooned amid danger, passion, and violence, her only chance of safety lies in Jamie Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior. What begins in compulsion becomes urgent need, and Claire finds herself torn between two very different men, in two irreconcilable lives.

Join the Random House Reader’s Circle for author chats and more.In boyhood, Louis Zamperini was an incorrigible delinquent. As a teenager, he channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics. But when World War II began, the athlete became an airman, embarking on a journey that led to a doomed flight on a May afternoon in 1943. When his Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean, against all odds, Zamperini survived, adrift on a foundering life raft. Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.

In his introduction Nicholas Brooke relates the play\'s changing fortunes to changes within society and the theatre and investigates the sources of its enduring appeal. He examines its many layers of illusion and interprets its linguistic turns and echoes, arguing that the earliest surviving text is an adaptation, perhaps carried out by Shakespeare himself in collaboration with Thomas Middleton. This fully annotated edition reconsiders textual and staging problems, appraises past and present critical views, and represents a major contribution to our understanding of Macbeth.

It is, quite simply, a contemporary masterpiece.“Piercingly observed, jaggedly poetic, ruthlessly cutting a path through graveyards of dead stars and dead money and dead feelings, this novel is the map back to dawn.”  — Steve Erickson“American Gods manages to reinvent, and reassert, the enduring importance of fantastic literature itself in this late age of the world.

A patient escapes from a biological testing facility, unknowingly carrying a deadly weapon: a mutated strain of super-flu that will wipe out 99 percent of the world’s population within a few weeks. Those who remain are scared, bewildered, and in need of a leader. Two emerge—Mother Abagail, the benevolent 108-year-old woman who urges them to build a peaceful community in Boulder, Colorado; and Randall Flagg, the nefarious “Dark Man,” who delights in chaos and violence.

Only the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the world of demons, keep order amidst the chaos.

Friendless and hunted, Tessa takes refuge with the Shadowhunters of the London Institute, who swear to find her brother if she will use her power to help them.

This Penguin Classics edition contains an introduction by Andrew Delblanco, with explanatory commentary by Tom Quirk.\'Call me Ishmael.\'So begins Herman Melville\'s masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. As Ishmael is drawn into Captain Ahab\'s obsessive quest to slay the white whale Moby-Dick, he finds himself engaged in a metaphysical struggle between good and evil. More than just a novel of adventure, more than an paean to whaling lore and legend, Moby-Dick is a haunting social commentary, populated by some of the most enduring characters in literature; the crew of the Pequod, from stern, Quaker First Mate Starbuck, to the tattooed Polynesian harpooner Queequeg, are a vision of the world in microcosm, the pinnacle of Melville\'s lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is a profound, poetic inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.Based on the Northwestern University Press edition, this Penguin Classics edition includes a critical introduction by Andrew Delbanco, as well as valuable explanatory notes, maps, illustrations and a glossary of nautical terms.Herman Melville is now regarded as one of America\'s greatest novelists. Much of the material for his novels was drawn from his own experience as a seaman aboard whaling ships. He wrote his masterpiece Moby-Dick in 1851, and died in 1891.If you enjoyed Moby-Dick, you may like Miguel de Cervantes\' Don Quixote, also available in Penguin Classics.\'After reading Moby-Dick, you will have enhanced your sense of wonder, you will have increased the size of your universe\'E.

As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all. Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society’s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever. Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.Praise for The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society“A jewel . . .

Henson, Danielle Brooks, and Fantasia Barrino. Celebrating its fortieth anniversary, The Color Purple writes a message of healing, forgiveness, self-discovery, and sisterhood to a new generation of readers. An inspiration to authors who continue to give voice to the multidimensionality of Black women\'s stories, including Tayari Jones, Honorée Fanonne Jeffers, Jesmyn Ward, and more, The Color Purple remains an essential read in conversation with storytellers today. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award A powerful cultural touchstone of modern American literature, The Color Purple depicts the lives of African American women in early-twentieth-century rural Georgia. Separated as girls, sisters Celie and Nettie sustain their loyalty to and hope in each other across time, distance, and silence. Through a series of letters spanning nearly thirty years, first from Celie to God, then from the sisters to each other, the novel draws readers into a rich and memorable portrayal of Black women--their pain and struggle, companionship and growth, resilience and bravery. Deeply compassionate and beautifully imagined, The Color Purple breaks the silence around domestic and sexual abuse, and carries readers on an epic and spirit-affirming journey toward transformation, redemption, and love. \"Reading The Color Purple was the first time I had seen Southern, Black women\'s literature as world literature. In writing us into the world--bravely, unapologetically, and honestly--Alice Walker has given us a gift we will never be able to repay.\" --Tayari Jones \"The Color Purple was what church should have been, what honest familial reckoning could have been, and it is still the only art object in the world by which all three generations of Black artists in my family judge American art.\" --Kiese Laymon", "https://www.amazon.sg/Color-Purple-Alice-Walker/dp/0143135694/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Ym8RByfRCoZpgbE_LeNQw-AOu3YPmIcRSEzKAureziUYdcSCJgPnBeSEdH80se0g_4896GVS_bYEtGZ2vTHs6JetzVxmG2Y6En_1Xunai110tMyudaqQlb1B692PFusnSvVXiCOf0KUXIayuQnPYgN4EPcSkuh9v2dIwh7jE8qkJVV54sYR-LRuaOh8SylMFX9GH5YtkdpKJoOBG007aTS8agQCTQqSWpyegL-Zxobg-lhXJSVe4VCmLw2TK-8xpi5tbVcmGQXrRiv_QZtdEHOncW9WRzlvWWyzSgVlrn1Y.aLzyYHC_Ja3rsSgsklKttMlvDKrMndCpyspz6UB4BbE&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Color+Purple+book&qid=1713332759&sr=8-1", 4.17, 376766, 1982,198),

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells--taken without her knowledge--became one of the most important tools in medicine: The first \"immortal\" human cells grown in culture, which are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb\'s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Henrietta\'s family did not learn of her \"immortality\" until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family--past and present--is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family--especially Henrietta\'s daughter Deborah. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn\'t her children afford health insurance? Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Immortal-Henrietta-Lacks-Rebecca-Skloot/dp/1400052181/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QuToyGQ8zdSi9gh--6Vj6ZMwP43XfncALMG7eK6kYg77u0wr3nfkM0QrICdlTCZxvxZKxyQl03A9tSR_FPJaCZFfDvazNPY2n-dDKlPZUV4p8uPWOhjRuraySdk8bphcttwGQPyn3eLAV8xQaVOPusbgBXfhdeRtPp_uE4hmopgH36WMSt0BMRhgMt6189_LdOswgG8K5GsWA4VN6mZFBbdKGKLIKxV653_tr7BE2cvEWblKEiXOo9Lj5b-IPRiIOvVO2_vqS_-giJW4fgkaZ_i6Xt6b9a97SkJPuVW9mgE.6l6q_BX_35bjZyQCkZvXTGYGK6p3rkGdKyOoL1YM9vY&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Immortal+Life+of+Henrietta+Lacks+book&qid=1713332842&sr=8-1", 4.04, 377249, 2010,208),

Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant-in the blink of an eye-that actually aren\'t as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren\'t those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\"-filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316010669/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PPnwb9tEqIMce3xyyiSPOGn8bbHIFiLoYCPl7P3GdiM2TtIlToJCLfJ2emZhxQfz7MbsepYgeJ8gaz7KgGyZahME_qOfH8GnxzmBccSfkwuDxWf0P1czj_tWRcxqyk7U9wMg20gjR-FVLjgBTh-aImTtZhe6ZwMUKWLz4LHLeMIH6fJMKPab1hN0dWl9RDSEp6r1nNTzMERWaA-tjrjoKnXt_pyQ9ayx3LuTxiXuAQyAe9yDIlp-0-IkSer0AG2tYTvgHNXUmHH5AiLZGWPQ5kDLcBhu0ZbpzgDx2SBXMJU.P3OQ-NWzwO9lS3gYSobvDgsN2BWY2Gva7sR9NEHShnc&dib_tag=se&keywords=Blink%3A+The+Power+of+Thinking+Without+Thinking+book&qid=1713332861&sr=8-1", 3.89, 348196, 2005,211),

It doesn’t hurt that this truth is stranger than fiction.” —The New York TimesCombining meticulous research with nail-biting storytelling, Erik Larson has crafted a narrative with all the wonder of newly discovered history and the thrills of the best fiction.Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America’s rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair’s brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country’s most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his “World’s Fair Hotel” just west of the fairgrounds—a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.The Devil in the White City draws the reader into the enchantment of the Guilded Age, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others.

Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.The masterpiece of Steinbeck’s later years, East of Eden is a work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love\'s absence. Adapted for the 1955 film directed by Elia Kazan introducing James Dean and read by thousands as the book that brought Oprah’s Book Club back, East of Eden has remained vitally present in American culture for over half a century.This edition features an introduction by David Wyatt.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

The first ten lies they tell you in high school. Speak up for yourself--we want to know what you have to say. From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. In Laurie Halse Anderson\'s powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school.

Everest Disaster", 26.15, "Jon Krakauer ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Iyp8W4SmL._SY466_.jpg", "#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER   • The epic account of the storm on the summit of Mt. Everest that claimed five lives and left countless more—including Krakauer\'s—in guilt-ridden disarray. \"A harrowing tale of the perils of high-altitude climbing, a story of bad luck and worse judgment and of heartbreaking heroism.\" —PEOPLEA bank of clouds was assembling on the not-so-distant horizon, but journalist-mountaineer Jon Krakauer, standing on the summit of Mt. Everest, saw nothing that \"suggested that a murderous storm was bearing down.\" He was wrong. By writing Into Thin Air, Krakauer may have hoped to exorcise some of his own demons and lay to rest some of the painful questions that still surround the event. He takes great pains to provide a balanced picture of the people and events he witnessed and gives due credit to the tireless and dedicated Sherpas. He also avoids blasting easy targets such as Sandy Pittman, the wealthy socialite who brought an espresso maker along on the expedition. Krakauer\'s highly personal inquiry into the catastrophe provides a great deal of insight into what went wrong. But for Krakauer himself, further interviews and investigations only lead him to the conclusion that his perceived failures were directly responsible for a fellow climber\'s death. Clearly, Krakauer remains haunted by the disaster, and although he relates a number of incidents in which he acted selflessly and even heroically, he seems unable to view those instances objectively. In the end, despite his evenhanded and even generous assessment of others\' actions, he reserves a full measure of vitriol for himself. This updated trade paperback edition of Into Thin Air includes an extensive new postscript that sheds fascinating light on the acrimonious debate that flared between Krakauer and Everest guide Anatoli Boukreev in the wake of the tragedy. \"I have no doubt that Boukreev\'s intentions were good on summit day,\" writes Krakauer in the postscript, dated August 1999. \"What disturbs me, though, was Boukreev\'s refusal to acknowledge the possibility that he made even a single poor decision. Never did he indicate that perhaps it wasn\'t the best choice to climb without gas or go down ahead of his clients.\" As usual, Krakauer supports his points with dogged research and a good dose of humility. But rather than continue the heated discourse that has raged since Into Thin Air\'s denouncement of guide Boukreev, Krakauer\'s tone is conciliatory; he points most of his criticism at G. Weston De Walt, who coauthored The Climb, Boukreev\'s version of events. And in a touching conclusion, Krakauer recounts his last conversation with the late Boukreev, in which the two weathered climbers agreed to disagree about certain points. Krakauer had great hopes to patch things up with Boukreev, but the Russian later died in an avalanche on another Himalayan peak, Annapurna I. In 1999, Krakauer received an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters--a prestigious prize intended \"to honor writers of exceptional accomplishment.\"  According to the Academy\'s citation, \"Krakauer combines the tenacity and courage of the finest tradition of investigative journalism with the stylish subtlety and profound insight of the born writer. His account of an ascent of Mount Everest has led to a general reevaluation of climbing and of the commercialization of what was once a romantic, solitary sport; while his account of the life and death of Christopher McCandless, who died of starvation after challenging the Alaskan wilderness, delves even more deeply and disturbingly into the fascination of nature and the devastating effects of its lure on a young and curious mind.\"", "https://www.amazon.sg/Into-Thin-Air-Personal-Disaster/dp/0385494785/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.s0bEC4khWN1n6Os5DFsn7l1QThCO7ec2DHw_gvzqnvBAG6fIiFmiljMrVX3hpO3ZTci-LIvQCDuwkLk5fBo3xPthkLflx0snG0Xy2eTj6_k.d5G0eIgYeVr0ms4e2X6alXFwjo1ktAxhMvvfr6Lj864&dib_tag=se&keywords=Into+Thin+Air%3A+A+Personal+Account+of+the+Mt.+Everest+Disaster+book&qid=1713333084&sr=8-1", 4.11, 291258, 1997,236),

He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.THE INSPIRATION FOR THE MAJOR MOTION PICTURE“Will spook you for real.”—The New York Times Book Review “Possesses more creativity and zip than entire crates of other new fiction titles.

It celebrates the art and craft of Hemingway’s quintessential story of the Lost Generation—presented by the Hemingway family with illuminating supplementary material from the Hemingway Collection at the John F. Kennedy Library. A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway’s most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates. It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illusions. First published in 1926, The Sun Also Rises is “an absorbing, beautifully and tenderly absurd, heartbreaking narrative...a truly gripping story, told in lean, hard, athletic prose” (The New York Times). The Hemingway Library Edition commemorates Hemingway’s classic novel with a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, the author’s sole surviving son, and an introduction by Sean Hemingway, grandson of the author.

Often scorned by neighbors for her family’s erratic and eccentric behavior―such as her father Johnny’s taste for alcohol and Aunt Sissy’s habit of marrying serially without the formality of divorce―no one, least of all Francie, could say that the Nolans’ life lacked drama. By turns overwhelming, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the Nolans’ daily experiences are raw with honestly and tenderly threaded with family connectedness. Betty Smith has, in the pages of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, captured the joys of humble Williamsburg life―from “junk day” on Saturdays, when the children traded their weekly take for pennies, to the special excitement of holidays, bringing cause for celebration and revelry. Smith has created a work of literary art that brilliantly captures a unique time and place as well as deeply resonant moments of universal experience. Here is an American classic that \"cuts right to the heart of life,\" hails the New York Times. \"If you miss A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, you will deny yourself a rich experience.\"", "https://www.amazon.sg/Tree-Grows-Brooklyn-75th-Anniversary/dp/0060736267/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6ZpaPBIb6TT158yrEvYIYX2uLFSFwq-jV6ZybpZbbhJSUTW1T5kbPeXfiGWulVOF2Yd9s3yG03jGSIc_XScFzWav0xAZTAwz2O9FMoDkFnLEzkNJ1moTkDNkzmxgC0fuxUH7Y8TPuSpPJp9tEX_Ql7lWVqb2gtC1RCSxp6Rvbicd59D4yoMuzQYyJHKAG1qAHL9IdkbWOLTKEpum9kOL1C8agQCTQqSWpyegL-ZxobiMbNiPS2T2eIfw9ZpHLeQtVX_e56zUGFHcpeCdayOqwZVE93GtPApYm0EC9flNLbk.c2-sJ5ObwRRpkMRrJ-AgXvc4y0wKo6aghE2N8cxlbpI&dib_tag=se&keywords=A+Tree+Grows+In+Brooklyn+book&qid=1713333355&sr=8-1", 4.24, 291909, 1943,265),

On stage, wearing her iconic red wig and sequined costumes, staring out at a sea of fans, is where she shines. Anyone would think she\'s the girl who has everything. But lately, she wants more. Siren Seven is wrapping up their farewell tour, and Ariel can\'t wait to spend the summer just living a normal life--part of a world she\'s only ever seen from the outside. But her father, the head of Atlantica Records, has other plans: begin her breakout solo career immediately, starting with a splashy announcement on a morning talk show. The night before, Ariel and her sisters sneak out of their Manhattan penthouse for a night of incognito fun at a rock concert in Brooklyn. It\'s there that Ariel crosses paths with Eric Reyes, dreamy lead singer of an up-and-coming band. Unaware of her true identity, Eric spontaneously invites her on the road for the summer.

She has nothing but time now, as she recounts the tale of Snow Flower, and asks the gods for forgiveness. In nineteenth-century China, when wives and daughters were foot-bound and lived in almost total seclusion, the women in one remote Hunan county developed their own secret code for communication: nu shu (“women’s writing”). Some girls were paired with laotongs, “old sames,” in emotional matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. With the arrival of a silk fan on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their friendship is sealed and they become “old sames” at the tender age of seven. As the years pass, through famine and rebellion, they reflect upon their arranged marriages, loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their lifelong friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a brilliantly realistic journey back to an era of Chinese history that is as deeply moving as it is sorrowful. With the period detail and deep resonance of Memoirs of a Geisha, this lyrical and emotionally charged novel delves into one of the most mysterious of human relationships: female friendship.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Snow-Flower-Secret-Fan-Novel/dp/0812980352/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ihpOeYZ8WNktV9wVZKdHIlW87svD8H_aG3uxk_zcDgzahqxWeijygl7SuwJfRgFv7ItWwXbM03htar28K7mKno1fByy_mreJzxhTHXMW0zlfupPjgN5h9xmf-Y6R3BVjyDs2sCtGEFammjLM4o45f0Ef5YU6WcK56YV_knyW7Nu0sEGHg53K3IUYf7avXeWBQQ3DyallwQiKDBpLG0DcncflI0avjyceAMF435RoHM3x277iFzPbS3IgeZe9caz7blFZnOP3YSBRwKxJmG1VIkDLcBhu0ZbpzgDx2SBXMJU.3xQ98gaTtfNREy9MCA7ittabJMyMIfE63w6xY2uR-1U&dib_tag=se&keywords=Snow+Flower+and+the+Secret+Fan+book&qid=1713333429&sr=8-1", 4.05, 280475, 2005,273),

Maya Angelou’s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide. Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local “powhitetrash.” At eight years old and back at her mother’s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age—and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (“I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare”) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned.

Beautiful.”—Ann PackerMoving between contemporary Maine and Depression-era Minnesota, Orphan Train is a powerful novel of upheaval and resilience, of second chances, and unexpected friendship.Between 1854 and 1929, so-called orphan trains ran regularly from the cities of the East Coast to the farmlands of the Midwest, carrying thousands of abandoned children whose fates would be determined by pure luck. Would they be adopted by a kind and loving family, or would they face a childhood and adolescence of hard labor and servitude?As a young Irish immigrant, Vivian Daly was one such child, sent by rail from New York City to an uncertain future a world away. Returning east later in life, Vivian leads a quiet, peaceful existence on the coast of Maine, the memories of her upbringing rendered a hazy blur. But in her attic, hidden in trunks, are vestiges of a turbulent past. Seventeen-year-old Molly Ayer knows that a community service position helping an elderly woman clean out her home is the only thing keeping her out of juvenile hall. But as Molly helps Vivian sort through her keepsakes and possessions, she discovers that she and Vivian aren\'t as different as they appear. A Penobscot Indian who has spent her youth in and out of foster homes, Molly is also an outsider being raised by strangers, and she, too, has unanswered questions about the past.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Orphan-Train-Christina-Baker-Kline/dp/0061950726/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.uGOAnlbht2fe67zGED1DNBopJBgPM830wJ2LU6MUQWnrRVV_tExhObgaThD1u1PcaLuXNkXkfpQ2xPBn-Vtp6r6SOORMPC7Zgfv2caQj3iQ_7eJ5-xMlju9Um4wLKo0pD5etwDO4lkTiu0HV82IyItA5x59vGG3Z_s1p4cchpsv80CXGJCXEg6fgTerT0cKuXFWQOTGpqUDk76VtkEo4RlyY0BD16SGdvYKXV1KCKNpB0WPfREMvdlWNj9Bgy6TVCE17LlAQ05MxQZ_IaA1VbpiLYSAyK3b34VgfbemjdIo.UV26WNy3VGslAGJDLFw7nmYvnyqUOFTtFyzipvr1c60&dib_tag=se&keywords=Orphan+Train+book&qid=1713333843&sr=8-1", 4.14, 226091, 2013,318),

In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand--and, if possible, answer--the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world\'s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds.

You can\'t help but cheer his victory.” —Los Angeles Times Book Review  By the time he entered a drug and alcohol treatment facility, James Frey had taken his addictions to near-deadly extremes. He had so thoroughly ravaged his body that the facility’s doctors were shocked he was still alive. The ensuing torments of detoxification and withdrawal, and the never-ending urge to use chemicals, are captured with a vitality and directness that recalls the seminal eye-opening power of William Burroughs’s Junky. But A Million Little Pieces refuses to fit any mold of drug literature. Inside the clinic, James is surrounded by patients as troubled as he is—including a judge, a mobster, a one-time world-champion boxer, and a fragile former prostitute to whom he is not allowed to speak—but their friendship and advice strikes James as stronger and truer than the clinic’s droning dogma of How to Recover. James refuses to consider himself a victim of anything but his own bad decisions, and insists on accepting sole accountability for the person he has been and the person he may become—which runs directly counter to his counselors\' recipes for recovery. James has to fight to find his own way to confront the consequences of the life he has lived so far, and to determine what future, if any, he holds.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts--Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak--that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, impeccably researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.

Especially relevant in today\'s world, this is a beautifully written book that will make you think. And, more importantly, it will make you feel.\"  -- Garth Stein, New York Times bestselling author of The Art of Racing in the Rain “Jamie Ford\'s first novel explores the age-old conflicts between father and son, the beauty and sadness of what happened to Japanese Americans in the Seattle area during World War II, and the depths and longing of deep-heart love. An impressive, bitter, and sweet debut.” -- Lisa See, bestselling author of Snow Flower and the Secret Fan  In the opening pages of Jamie Ford’s stunning debut novel, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, Henry Lee comes upon a crowd gathered outside the Panama Hotel, once the gateway to Seattle’s Japantown. It has been boarded up for decades, but now the new owner has made an incredible discovery: the belongings of Japanese families, left when they were rounded up and sent to internment camps during World War II. As Henry looks on, the owner opens a Japanese parasol. This simple act takes old Henry Lee back to the 1940s, at the height of the war, when young Henry’s world is a jumble of confusion and excitement, and to his father, who is obsessed with the war in China and having Henry grow up American. While “scholarshipping” at the exclusive Rainier Elementary, where the white kids ignore him, Henry meets Keiko Okabe, a young Japanese American student. Amid the chaos of blackouts, curfews, and FBI raids, Henry and Keiko forge a bond of friendship–and innocent love–that transcends the long-standing prejudices of their Old World ancestors. And after Keiko and her family are swept up in the evacuations to the internment camps, she and Henry are left only with the hope that the war will end, and that their promise to each other will be kept. Forty years later, Henry Lee is certain that the parasol belonged to Keiko. In the hotel’s dark dusty basement he begins looking for signs of the Okabe family’s belongings and for a long-lost object whose value he cannot begin to measure. Now a widower, Henry is still trying to find his voice–words that might explain the actions of his nationalistic father; words that might bridge the gap between him and his modern, Chinese American son; words that might help him confront the choices he made many years ago. Set during one of the most conflicted and volatile times in American history, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet is an extraordinary story of commitment and enduring hope. In Henry and Keiko, Jamie Ford has created an unforgettable duo whose story teaches us of the power of forgiveness and the human heart.BONUS: This edition contains a Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet discussion guide and an excerpt from Jamie Ford\'s Love and Other Consolation Prizes.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Hotel-Corner-Bitter-Sweet-Jamie/dp/0345505344/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ydRGEl77M_NX510i_WcjPyJyfDZpQlezF21oL6T8_oUBCMWw59TkdzR54ILzffvW3YhJkW0k6lbkS0rr-ULcAw6uNm-vD01RaQFry0QsL2kZDSdRJJ6uDJhZ0Uwgpfo1HC0SK8PVvQB4dp9gfLGw78eCd1tE7iB-_dfUQSj8bjp8P8oO3kIv6ECDo0uVK9ca75-4q1Dr1fMGOqe5sKmhIef05JaXXBNHdpzHcJLqRixEdD9pIBSKwWY9tSTlCDoKKFYO4zzUH-YRAr5owvmpe6s-ygRVhHAreOCibt39OAE.I6HBu9MeCF_CJD5VajOP79STyH1PUrxdFYjBTS4Il7M&dib_tag=se&keywords=Hotel+on+the+Corner+of+Bitter+and+Sweet+book&qid=1713334541&sr=8-1", 3.98, 197294, 2009,396),

Around that time, the developmental paths of human societies on different continents began to diverge greatly. Early domestication of wild plants and animals in the Fertile Crescent, China, Mesoamerica, the Andes, and other areas gave peoples of those regions a head start at a new way of life. But the localized origins of farming and herding proved to be only part of the explanation for their differing fates. The unequal rates at which food production spread from those initial centers were influenced by other features of climate and geography, including the disparate sizes, locations, and even shapes of the continents. Only societies that moved away from the hunter-gatherer stage went on to develop writing, technology, government, and organized religions as well as deadly germs and potent weapons of war. It was those societies, adventuring on sea and land, that invaded others, decimating native inhabitants through slaughter and the spread of disease.A major landmark in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way in which the modern world, and its inequalities, came to be.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393354326/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.GQUpCoscdUO8yljPdEqDg_2mk_T59YjU7XxyLOoERfVMHWcKJ9uhZi1ujml0NgItPa5yVkv0jzZMBX0f0pg1098G4fB_fCgLUi0kToZAgrGj_JAqPcK21aWtb_Ay1JzvbyItUlTHeKSSRiRe8dye8s57lgRETJMkF1IvNvjeIyVfHFvzZaxlpg6tCQb14d1GXMAwhKaXmwKuDuF564CV-_atMyutxR6jSdVYeDeHCiXtecsvCKBMGmAXgSUau2D2rHb4Dl1bSu3GEgV1znVM0XLVDwY0XdLvKAaEBMfnPh8.E3AtDiFGXxPaIkAM-66iKb0GLsL3eXTkSCeL7xSoj_4&dib_tag=se&keywords=Guns%2C+Germs%2C+and+Steel%3A+The+Fates+of+Human+Societies+book&qid=1713334629&sr=8-1", 4.0, 171558, 1997,408),

It is a classic narrative about Africa\'s cataclysmic encounter with Europe as it establishes a colonial presence on the continent.

With more than 20 million copies sold and translated into fifty-seven languages, Things Fall Apart provides one of the most illuminating and permanent monuments to African experience.

Patch está empezando a alejarse y Nora no sabe si es por su bien o porque cada vez está más interesado en su archienemiga Marcie Millar.

A medida que Nora se sumerge en el misterio de su muerte, comienza a sospechar que su sangre nefilim puede estar relacionada con el asunto.

Despite starting a relationship with her guardian angel, Patch (who, title aside, can be described anything but angelic), and surviving an attempt on her life, things are not looking up. Patch is starting to pull away and Nora can\'t figure out if it\'s for her best interest or if his interest has shifted to her arch-enemy Marcie Millar. Not to mention that Nora is haunted by images of her father and she becomes obsessed with finding out what really happened to him that night he left for Portland and never came home.

Since Patch isn\'t answering her questions and seems to be standing in her way, she has to start finding the answers on her own.

The Grimke’s daughter, Sarah, has known from an early age she is meant to do something large in the world, but she is hemmed in by the limits imposed on women.Kidd’s sweeping novel is set in motion on Sarah’s eleventh birthday, when she is given ownership of ten year old Handful, who is to be her handmaid. We follow their remarkable journeys over the next thirty five years, as both strive for a life of their own, dramatically shaping each other’s destinies and forming a complex relationship marked by guilt, defiance, estrangement and the uneasy ways of love.As the stories build to a riveting climax, Handful will endure loss and sorrow, finding courage and a sense of self in the process. Sarah will experience crushed hopes, betrayal, unrequited love, and ostracism before leaving Charleston to find her place alongside her fearless younger sister, Angelina, as one of the early pioneers in the abolition and women’s rights movements.Inspired by the historical figure of Sarah Grimke, Kidd goes beyond the record to flesh out the rich interior lives of all of her characters, both real and invented, including Handful’s cunning mother, Charlotte, who courts danger in her search for something better.This exquisitely written novel is a triumph of storytelling that looks with unswerving eyes at a devastating wound in American history, through women whose struggles for liberation, empowerment, and expression will leave no reader unmoved.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Invention-Wings-Sue-Monk-Kidd/dp/0143121707/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WwM6uZsTGOTidzkkuoXhxrtx1AebD9LXoy8I8ISzpUrHIdGAGzoD0zHK2DSkWCpfSsOO4_d8R8Po4kqLYAdqrA9adGD3qpt4DndtD1SJzvOFhNtDv2QTZcU4Al4QRBfXV6rKSyg2winhtaBql4jzGKCmVKkjUUDt0fiGS8A3QNpqC7h2LRH9SvGtFJzwcPbF6OdZ6Yb-j3XZ0c_wyrt7KDzwcD0BxRX14tuJQXPfBYUZTurQesgkkU3Ub6M9Acy5TrdCw3fJkwDvRVdc--fKGKYGV11r98VfMT5Az2gDNkk.w8sIwGKzlLj7HGjIksHOGEZIdnRie21IGKy0h5Nc_Ak&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Invention+of+Wings+book&qid=1713334880&sr=8-1", 4.23, 168006, 2014,437),

The period is the ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men, when the famous forest of Mirkwood was still standing, and the mountains were full of danger. In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way (as he did) -- if you do not already know all about these things -- much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves, and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period. For Mr. Bilbo Baggins visited various notable persons; conversed with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent; and was present, rather unwillingly, at the Battle of the Five Armies. This is all the more remarkable, since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend, perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement. But this account, based on his personal memoirs, of the one exciting year in the otherwise quiet life of Mr. Baggins will give you a fair idea of the estimable people now (it is said) becoming rather rare.

As dusk approaches a small Dublin suburb in the summer of 1984, mothers begin to call their children home. But on this warm evening, three children do not return from the dark and silent woods. When the police arrive, they find only one of the children gripping a tree trunk in terror, wearing blood-filled sneakers, and unable to recall a single detail of the previous hours. Twenty years later, the found boy, Rob Ryan, is a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad and keeps his past a secret. But when a twelve-year-old girl is found murdered in the same woods, he and Detective Cassie Maddox—his partner and closest friend—find themselves investigating a case chillingly similar to the previous unsolved mystery. Now, with only snippets of long-buried memories to guide him, Ryan has the chance to uncover both the mystery of the case before him and that of his own shadowy past.

From the sex-obsessed tyrant in the Old Testament to the more benign Celestial Watchmaker favored by some Enlightenment thinkers, Dawkins rigorously analyzes God in all his forms, eviscerating the major arguments for religion and demonstrating the supreme improbability of a supreme being. His argument steeped in impressive historical and contemporary evidence, spanning from the Crusades to 9/11, Dawkins shows how religion fuels war and foments bigotry, and makes the compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong but potentially deadly.

This first edition credited the work\'s fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, leading many readers to believe he was a real person and the book a travelogue of true incidents. It was published under the considerably longer original title The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver\'d by Pyrates. Epistolary, confessional, and didactic in form, the book is a fictional autobiography of the title character (whose birth name is Robinson Kreutznaer)—a castaway who spends years on a remote tropical island near Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers before being rescued. The story is widely perceived to have been influenced by the life of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on the Pacific island called \"Más a Tierra\" (in 1966 its name was changed to Robinson Crusoe Island), Chile. However, other possible sources have been put forward for the text. It is possible, for example, that Defoe was inspired by the Latin or English translations of Ibn Tufail\'s Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, an earlier novel also set on a desert island. Another source for Defoe\'s novel may have been Robert Knox\'s account of his abduction by the King of Ceylon in 1659 in \"An Historical Account of the Island Ceylon,\" Glasgow: James MacLehose and Sons (Publishers to the University), 1911. In his 2003 book In Search of Robinson Crusoe, Tim Severin contends that the account of Henry Pitman in a short book chronicling his escape from a Caribbean penal colony and subsequent shipwrecking and desert island misadventures, is the inspiration for the story. Arthur Wellesley Secord in his Studies in the narrative method of Defoe (1963: 21-111) painstakingly analyses the composition of Robinson Crusoe and gives a list of possible sources of the story, rejecting the common theory that the story of Selkirk is Defoe\'s only source.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Strange-Surprising-Adventures-Robinson-Mariner/dp/1532915527/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.08Pl3Znxn52btZ4KCHavTsgSn4zg9W8SBws0KKq7vtn63X1nbfld5356F2ng9e33eDEexXi97Y6hDmOkRG0V_U8KU1eu5K9Zy7X-iTCriPTbY7oreY3RN8wr90ek-uHf0q85N_lkVfKA7xg_YZJGUCcTLqEnxZImAdpadLeKSpSsJ6LDfmRu7N6pvmPWkP_uj1kZepa-f16N2k5KpAE3SYbmUGm--DkZZCsoDVSq45KrfHha8_5HKe0BRTOFRpZhbhtW1ATqEaW61K90UKLA_P22UyQZEEFknli3d8HXu_k.YdNkopaNMKCW01ZygWip7ss9TfKUoavfOaNY6TK1lUg&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Life+and+Strange+Surprising+Adventures+of+Robinson+Crusoe+of+York%2C+Mariner+book&qid=1713335227&sr=8-1", 3.66, 178188, 1719,478),

It’s not fun to think about, but now there’s good news: This doesn’t have to happen.Dr. Sian Beilock, an expert on performance and brain science, reveals in Choke the astonishing new science of why we all too often blunder when the stakes are high. What happens in our brain and body when we experience the dreaded performance anxiety? And what are we doing differently when everything magically “clicks” into place and the perfect golf swing, tricky test problem, or high-pressure business pitch becomes easy? In an energetic tour of the latest brain science, with surprising insights on every page, Beilock explains the inescapable links between body and mind; reveals the surprising similarities among the ways performers, students, athletes, and business people choke; and shows how to succeed brilliantly when it matters most. In lively prose and accessibly rendered science, Beilock examines how attention and working memory guide human performance, how experience and practice and brain development interact to create our abilities, and how stress affects all these factors. She sheds new light on counterintuitive realities, like why the highest performing people are most susceptible to choking under pressure, why we may learn foreign languages best when we’re not paying attention, why early childhood athletic training can backfire, and how our emotions can make us both smarter and dumber. All these fascinating findings about academic, athletic, and creative intelligence come together in Beilock’s new ideas about performance under pressure—and her secrets to never choking again. Whether you’re at the Olympics, in the boardroom, or taking the SAT, Beilock’s clear, prescriptive guidance shows how to remain cool under pressure—the key to performing well when everything’s on the line.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Choke-Secrets-Brain-Reveal-Getting/dp/1416596186/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.SL1iYh4svAy9ZSs7cYEEyVwpAFr718nKlT5cg1zOrb-7rCFyKd_NbhbollspLpISAIDswWv-lEcqQMdfga0Q0YrdD8YPiRIl7oefMKnvCqVr267fem-YRnp4mZ4Ri45Whfv0Fs_NbeoBLUVaM7JgWkKU1oDMDqMm48ys9_cmVs7_5lyE2fJZuxFJJkfx4y78kBAp1IaPuR9fBskP0ea5eKzx9jF8GoMoYFqoxRjz-OabdpPMauoL57QnkEgNUJ6jRazrXtnvUJ2XEbXRUk5JeAVm-ztWAvZzp2nGBVXvrY4.FpKNk_B6XwBLPkhjocpz4WWR0QsM-7DY7YQE0lrHf6k&dib_tag=se&keywords=Choke+book&qid=1713335282&sr=8-1", 3.69, 154643, 2001,484),

It is a moralistic tale of the life of the horse related in the form of an autobiography, describing the world through the eyes of the creature. In taking this anthropomorphic approach, the author Anna Sewell broke new literary ground and her effective storytelling ability makes it very easy for the reader to accept the premise that a horse is recounting the exploits in the narrative. The gentle thoroughbred, Black Beauty, is raised with care and is treated well until a vicious groom injures him. The damaged horse is then sold to various masters at whose hands he experiences cruelty and neglect. After many unpleasant episodes, including one where he becomes a painfully overworked cab horse in London, Black Beauty finally canters towards a happy ending. Although Anna Sewell\'s classic is set firmly in the Victorian period, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness.

Millions of Americans work full time, year round, for poverty-level wages. In 1998, Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that a jobany jobcan be the ticket to a better life. But how does anyone survive, let alone prosper, on $6 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich left her home, took the cheapest lodgings she could find, and accepted whatever jobs she was offered. Moving from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, she worked as a waitress, a hotel maid, a cleaning woman, a nursing-home aide, and a Wal-Mart sales clerk. She lived in trailer parks and crumbling residential motels. Very quickly, she discovered that no job is truly \"unskilled,\" that even the lowliest occupations require exhausting mental and muscular effort. She also learned that one job is not enough; you need at least two if you int to live indoors.Nickel and Dimed reveals low-rent America in all its tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generositya land of Big Boxes, fast food, and a thousand desperate stratagems for survival. Read it for the smoldering clarity of Ehrenreich\'s perspective and for a rare view of how \"prosperity\" looks from the bottom.

Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise’s homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town, and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past—a journey that can only be guided by one’s own conscience.Written in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of the late Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor, and effortless precision—a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times.

However, his nose throbbed painfully, which he thought odd in the circumstances. Jamie Fraser is, alas, not dead—but he is in hell. Waking among the fallen on Culloden Field, he is concerned neither for his men nor his wounds but for his wife and their unborn child. Lord, he prayed passionately, that she may be safe. She and the child. It’s a prayer he’ll utter many times over the next twenty years, never knowing but always hoping that Claire made it through the standing stones, back to the safety of her own time.Safe she is, but believing Jamie gone forever, she’s obliged to live without a heart, her only comfort their daughter, Brianna. But now, their daughter grown, she discovers that Jamie survived, and a fateful decision lies before her: Stay with her beloved daughter, or go back to search Scotland’s dangerous past for the man who was her heart and soul, sustained only by the hope that they will still know each other if she finds him.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Voyager-25th-Anniversary-Novel-3/dp/1984818228/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HZm-0JUIoEAfH44gGSglhMZK72VIBDj3YfQ4qxFoSEOrJXQJ-zPgNYWMbFo-4t1WuLSHNYgP2CWxvUm6K-wqu75J1opk4ytgTOX0qDP_dYkXwGA6Uz7J7yYu-KAMMy1sTQLBgWgqIKILS54MWT9lzqXoXub-e7Dk2FvI3oAMypb3S-Ai7L8AqIGaGm2uKS2XuR88WdmqOwB9S0K_592asNf3-1vJId9fwlTvBlYDb3n7IeDrehErBIxJeARnXF29rk4UwjxvCU3Opn81TcLma0sAAM9jMtHaD7VfBZ988Aw.N-OG4wZy6Fb3dU9z4uh3oAiLLHRlDjZHoCHmRyjvscA&dib_tag=se&keywords=Voyager+book&qid=1713336995&sr=8-1", 4.38, 157395, 1993,554),

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them. One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable. Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity. Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar\'s niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan\'s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war. The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making. Speak again the ancient oaths: Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination. and return to men the Shards they once bore. The Knights Radiant must stand again.

The killer left no clues. There were no witnesses, no one with a motive. But the police soon came to suspect Quincy Miller, a young Black man who was once a client of Russo’s. Quincy was tried, convicted, and sent to prison for life. For twenty-two years he languished in prison, maintaining his innocence. But no one was listening. He had no lawyer, no advocate on the outside. In desperation, he writes a letter to Guardian Ministries, a small nonprofit run by Cullen Post, a lawyer who is also an Episcopal minister. Guardian accepts only a few innocence cases at a time. Cullen Post travels the country fighting wrongful convictions and taking on clients forgotten by the system. With Quincy Miller, though, he gets far more than he bargained for. Powerful, ruthless people murdered Keith Russo, and they do not want Quincy Miller exonerated.

Kiyosaki ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BE7eeKzAL._SY466_.jpg", "April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the personal finance classic Rich Dad Poor Dad that still ranks as the #1 Personal Finance book of all time. And although 25 years have passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published, readers will find that very little in the book itself has changed ― and for good reason. While so much in our world is changing a high speed, the lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad Poor Dad haven’t changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role in our daily lives, the messages in Robert Kiyosaki’s international bestseller are more timely and more important than ever. Milestones While there is a milestone  to commemorate ― and a new section in the book on Why Milestones Are Important ― preserving the integrity of the original content is testimony to the fact that this book has truly stood the test of time. The sidebars throughout the book (that were updated for the 20-year anniversary edition) have been updated again, but the core principles that parents and grandparents ― those who embraced Robert’s story and messages 25 years ago ― are sharing them with new generations who have found that its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense lessons can be applied to anyone’s life and their vision for a future that includes taking control of their finances. People of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones. We use them to measure time, mark progress, reflect on the lessons we’ve learned, and celebrate accomplishments… and they give meaning to our life’s journey. They are a way that we integrate past, present, and future… looking back at where we started, where we are today… and the promise of all that the future can hold. In the quarter century that has passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published ― 25 years since April 8, 1997 ― so many things in our world have changed. But the one thing that has not changed is the pressing need for and the power of financial education. Money is still a mainstay of our lives, like it or not, and technology has brought both speed and innovations to the world of money. In an ever-changing world, we can all still get smarter when it comes to money… and learn as much as we can to secure our future. Still the One… #1 Today Rich Dad Poor Dad consistently ranks among bestsellers around the world in the categories of Personal Finance, Parenting, and Investing, has been translated into 38 languages, and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert\'s story of growing up with two dads ― his real father and the father of his best friend, his rich dad ― and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you. In many ways, the messages of Rich Dad Poor Dad, messages that were challenged and criticized 25 ago, are more meaningful, relevant, and important today than ever. Rich Dad Poor Dad...   • Explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to become rich   • Challenges the belief that your house is an asset   • Shows parents why they can\'t rely on the school system to teach their kids about money   • Defines once and for all an asset and a liability   • Teaches you what to teach your kids about money for their future financial success", "https://www.amazon.sg/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612681131/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.AaJ3BPKStGt1JOzkqMhZr5J9AC0uyLm61VnjNkBAH56X3jMrA8Tj3hURC8kGbQxIOWvUJwU5ynxx3NEfh1YySuS35cIzCsGLNwiyPTsm2pTxNHj9oiVHpXLU-tNXjTGw_p_xQMoTULF1tAE65o6Vtofa1AtNhGRC-XsIfAtVcvoZQH1tyiwCoSpamYvVqpzbZ736AbYSTVb8OXAAZVLrRHdmjGupOZCEglmzSma2BSmeMigiWhVdQrUsGCQTSHAAll9B8NQZbBH4wjP3R9QB3kFxYbxRKdJAa54romfoyxQ.h-gR2IoWASM0eWIEciOTwhWjYPjbjfIfejQTlIK7r_k&dib_tag=se&keywords=Rich+Dad+%2C+Poor+Dad+book&qid=1713337195&sr=8-1", 3.95, 153764, 1997,582),

R. Martin, Junot Díaz, and Erin Morgenstern. The Magicians Quentin Coldwater is brilliant but miserable. A high school math genius, he’s secretly fascinated with a series of children’s fantasy novels set in a magical land called Fillory, and real life is disappointing by comparison. When Quentin is unexpectedly admitted to an elite, secret college of magic, it looks like his wildest dreams may have come true. But his newfound powers lead him down a rabbit hole of hedonism and disillusionment, and ultimately to the dark secret behind the story of Fillory. The land of his childhood fantasies turns out to be much darker and more dangerous than he ever could have imagined . . .The Magicians is one of the most daring and inventive works of literary fantasy in years. No one who has escaped into the worlds of Narnia and Harry Potter should miss this breathtaking return to the landscape of the imagination.The Magician KingQuentin Coldwater should be happy. He escaped a miserable Brooklyn childhood, matriculated at a secret college for magic, and graduated to discover that Fillory—a fictional utopia—was actually real. But even as a Fillorian king, Quentin finds little peace. His old restlessness returns, and he longs for the thrills a heroic quest can bring.Accompanied by his oldest friend, Julia, Quentin sets off—only to somehow wind up back in the real-world and not in Fillory, as they’d hoped. As the pair struggle to find their way back to their lost kingdom, Quentin is forced to rely on Julia’s illicitly learned sorcery as they face a sinister threat in a world very far from the beloved fantasy novels of their youth.The Magician\'s LandQuentin Coldwater has lost everything. He has been cast out of Fillory, the secret magical world of his childhood dreams that he once ruled. With nothing left to lose he returns to where his story began, the Brakebills Preparatory College of Magic. But he can’t hide from his past, and it’s not long before it comes looking for him. Meanwhile, the magical barriers that keep Fillory safe are failing, and barbarians from the north have invaded. Eliot and Janet, the rulers of Fillory, embark on a final quest to save their beloved world, only to discover a situation far more complex—and far more dire—than anyone had envisioned.Along with Plum, a brilliant young magician with a dark secret of her own, Quentin sets out on a crooked path through a magical demimonde of gray magic and desperate characters. His new life takes him back to old haunts, like Antarctica and the Neitherlands, and old friends he thought were lost forever. The Magician’s Land is an intricate and fantastical thriller, and an epic of love and redemption that brings the Magicians trilogy to a magnificent conclusion, confirming it as one of the great achievements in modern fantasy.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Magicians-Trilogy-Boxed-Set-Magician/dp/0147517389/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oHA4N2_Mn-U6BhsSRPp2QBgS6rfUNCqDXDvNdXfNFS9OWWlZcmk7IffiYQ-CwLJNSJ9CxDhw3VnGu54ulxP9b8NE3ZTDg_AQoau16BtAADnKpRnAEdKtq8ft7HrmSjSsjH-uI0JtK0nI5a4gCzhBU-IG4GNMsDRpYew2w1Pi_WMKX7yXGK-tXwBhy5sR7S1uPprYNZKSG0BpjkFFi69jJ7Aa1EaGtFNzlrRoEt8eA11bqioU01D-KtnlADFPgpGgzhsxP1bX5QfCd6x-tsZIM7l7Nu-AMtmdX0a84yKi4Vs.bv3HVIvH2jLFIMPIXXTVUdZNf6v2FzrNprtRIlLU5uM&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Magicians+book&qid=1713337211&sr=8-1", 3.47, 147908, 2009,584),

Hoy se reedita --en edición limitada-- para conmemorar los cuatrocientos años de la muerte de Cervantes. En los años 2015 y 2016 confluyen dos aniversarios cervantinos. A la celebración del IV Centenario de la Publicación de la Segunda Parte del Quijote (2015), le seguirá, en 2016, la conmemoración del IV Centenario de la Muerte de Miguel de Cervantes. Como ocurrió hace más de una década, las academias de la lengua española y la editorial Alfaguara se unen a esta celebración con una reedición de este clásico universal dirigida a todo el ámbito hispanohablante. Esta edición cuenta con un nuevo prólogo, escrito por Darío Villanueva, director de la Real Academia Española (RAE) y presidente de la Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española (ASALE), especialmente para la ocasión. Se completa con un glosario formado por siete mil palabras, locuciones, frases proverbiales y refranes, explicados según el significado preciso que tienen en el texto cervantino. La primera edición de este Quijote se convirtió en un gran éxito de ventas, sin precedentes en una obra clásica. Más de tres millones de ejemplares, distribuidos en España y América, la convirtieron en la más difundida de la historia. A conseguir su carácter divulgativo y su orientación hacia un público diverso y no especializado, contribuyen especialmente las notas contextualizadoras de la obra, preparadas por Francisco Rico. También se incluyen una serie de estudios complementarios, escritos por algunos de los principales expertos en el gran libro cervantino. Así, Mario Vargas Llosa analiza la modernidad del Quijote en «Una novela para el siglo xxi»; Francisco Ayala reflexiona sobre la construcción de los personajes de la novela en «La invención del Quijote», y Martín de Riquer analiza la obra en el contexto biográfico del autor en «Cervantes y el Quijote». Por su parte, José Manuel Blecua («El Quijote en la historia de la lengua española»), Guillermo Rojo («Cervantes como modelo lingüístico»), José Antonio Pascual («Los registros lingüísticos del Quijote: la distancia irónica de la realidad»), Margit Frenk («Oralidad, escritura, lectura») y Claudio Guillén («Cauces de la novela cervantina: perspectivas y diálogos») abordan distintos aspectos relacionados con la lengua española en la obra cervantina. A todos ellos se une en esta ocasión el actual director de la RAE, Darío Villanueva, que ha querido «aprovechar la oportunidad de oro que me ofrece hoy la nueva salida de esta edición [...] para dar una explicación --mi explicación-- de algunos de los porqués del tan alto reconocimiento que el Quijote ha obtenido desde la fecha de su publicación hasta hoy, así como su palmaria modernidad», antes de recordar que el Quijote fue la obra elegida, en 2002, como la mejor novela de todos los tiempos, por delante de En busca del tiempo perdido, de Proust, y de Guerra y paz, de Tolstoi, en una encuesta realizada por la Asociación de Escritores de Suecia entre cien autores de todo el mundo. ENGLISH DESCRIPTIONNominated as one of America\'s best-loved novels by PBS\'s The Great American ReadTen years ago, the Academies of the Spanish Language conceived of a Don Quixote for everyone. Now, it is being re-released--in a limited edition--to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Cervantes\'s death. 2015 and 2016 bring with them two special Cervantes anniversaries. The celebration of the 400th Anniversary of the Publication of the Second Part of Don Quixote in 2015 will be followed in 2016 by the Commemoration of the 400th Anniversary of Miguel de Cervantes\'s Death. As they did more than a decade ago, the Academies of the Spanish Language and Alfaguara unite for this celebration with a re-edition of the universal classic directed at the whole Spanish-speaking world. This edition boasts a new prologue written specially for the occasion by Darío Villanueva, the director of the Real Academia de la Lengua Española (RAE) (RAE) and president of the Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española (ASALE). It is complemented by a glossary made up of seven thousand words, expressions, phrases and proverbs, each explained according to its precise meaning in Cervantes\'s text. The first edition of this Quixote became a huge sales success, unprecedented for a classic work. More than three million copies, distributed in Spain and the Americas, made it the most widespread in history. The contextualizing notes about the work, prepared by Francisco Rico, contribute to its educational character and its orientation toward a diverse and non-specialized public. It also includes a series of complementary studies, written by some of the primary experts in Cervantes\'s consummate book. As such, Mario Vargas Llosa analyzes the modernity of Don Quixote in \"A Novel for the 21st Century;\" Francisco Ayala reflects upon the construction of the novel\'s characters in \"The Invention of the Quixote;\" and Martín de Riquer analyzes the work in the biographical context of the author in \"Cervantes and Quixote.\" For their part, José Manuel Blecua (\"Don Quixote in the History of the Spanish Language\"), Guillermo Rojo (\"Cervantes as a Linguistic Model\"), José Antonio Pascual (\"The Linguistic Registers of Don Quixote: The Ironic Distance from Reality\"), Margit Frenk (\"Orality, Writing, Reading\"), and Claudio Guillén (\"The Course of Cervantes\'s novel: Perspectives and Dialogues\") deal with different aspects related to the Spanish language in Cervantes\'s work. Joining all this is the current director of the Real Academia de la Lengua Española (RAE), Darío Villanueva, who wants to \"take advantage of the golden opportunity that the release of this new edition offers [...] to give an explanation--my explanation--of some of the reasons for the high recognition that Don Quixote has gained from the date of its publication until today, as well as its clear modernity,\" before reminding us that Don Quixote was the work chosen in 2002 as the best novel of all time, even ahead of In Search of Lost Time by Proust and War and Peace by Tolstoy, in a survey conducted by the Swiss Writers\' Association of 100 authors from around the world.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Don-Quijote-Mancha-Edici%C3%B3n-Quixote/dp/8420412147/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2h69Wqpfc6In2Ff00pgJu5ycSRqx5lg25zNx5RdnRT62-J0yPsfRcUtu4qdOjeXEyVnOMQBfCD73q2qKfcSA0kT6q0OSUajbXThke--x5qq92IPJvYd0pel0I7_qMOHx29yp_96edlW-Dkv2WKAxaB_UZ1NrkjXl0W5Y1X6MH9TbS3MEOyFzOeFeMbJbVttgViBEMNyQuHhOU--bfgCn_OnKskZiS0RxS0OKTMHs42jtu4fLsnCwmZVzmGUoCn_iG9YyAAM4IOqtsX0EMhBxezNwAVHt5Gc4e6mDGBH-y68.-YdOSZb3FfpeisvioQR-__Rp9b8C6bPEfTPpNz_1bb8&dib_tag=se&keywords=Don+Quijote+de+La+Mancha+book&qid=1713337299&sr=8-1", 3.85, 134931, 1605,597),

What they saw introduced a radical concept that swept through biology and medicine, touching virtually every aspect of the two sciences, and altering both forever. It was the fact that complex living organisms are assemblages of tiny, self-contained, self-regulating units. Our organs, our physiology, our selves--hearts, blood, brains--are built from these compartments. Hooke christened them \"cells.\" The discovery of cells--and the reframing of the human body as a cellular ecosystem--announced the birth of a new kind of medicine based on the therapeutic manipulations of cells. A hip fracture, a cardiac arrest, Alzheimer\'s dementia, AIDS, pneumonia, lung cancer, kidney failure, arthritis, COVID pneumonia--all could be reconceived as the results of cells, or systems of cells, functioning abnormally. And all could be perceived as loci of cellular therapies. Filled with writing so vivid, lucid, and suspenseful that complex science becomes thrilling, The Song of the Cell tells the story of how scientists discovered cells, began to understand them, and are now using that knowledge to create new humans. Told in six parts, and laced with Mukherjee\'s own experience as a researcher, a doctor, and a prolific reader, The Song of the Cell is both panoramic and intimate--a masterpiece on what it means to be human. \"In an account both lyrical and capacious, Mukherjee takes us through an evolution of human understanding: from the seventeenth-century discovery that humans are made up of cells to our cutting-edge technologies for manipulating and deploying cells for therapeutic purposes\" (The New Yorker).", "https://www.amazon.sg/Song-Cell-Exploration-Medicine-Human/dp/1982117362/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9jf89UE0NZLNfyHWdSifMYjW3rHRSv1ptNa0yy-icEEdNzg03H-AnH7jKqGIewZN7GtksrapwQTD2jpBCEEl8VmvDx_gFtv6545q9qq1mOFos0XHpP0O_F_pNL7RiFq0FlckUP5kUKV7TN8Eigyizpo2MPo7FjChlQ_2axB9z2Jmg8BydMSlO9D7-kor48SAAKhOgydxLTZXoewuY6_xA9j-SJCeYJzQNfIOxOmpgYUOlOnASzR2alhCAcAUGL3XlFhNRWZf3UihBwu_NupEFE43HT6jYAQ3VuXQTl-5St4.CMsTxgwdaook_OwpFWeHs2TOUi-Ant_KcDyba7NbmF8&dib_tag=se&keywords=Cell+book&qid=1713337394&sr=8-1", 3.64, 144591, 2006,609),

Tolkien himself and with the complete text printed in two colors. The Silmarillion fills in the background which lies behind the more popular work, and gives the earlier history of Middle-earth, introducing some of the key characters.The Silmarilli were three perfect jewels, fashioned by Fëanor, most gifted of the Elves, and within them was imprisoned the last Light of the Two Trees of Valinor. But the first Dark Lord, Morgoth, stole the jewels and set them within his iron crown, guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth.The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Fëanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all the heroism, against the great Enemy. It is the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings look back, and in whose events some of them such as Elrond and Galadriel took part.The book also includes several shorter works: the Ainulindalë, a myth of the Creation, and the Valaquenta, in which the nature and powers of each of the gods is described. The Akallabêth recounts the downfall of the great island kingdom of Númenor at the end of the Second Age, and Of the Rings of Power tells of the great events at the end of the Third Age, as narrated in The Lord of the Rings.Tolkien could not publish The Silmarillion in his lifetime, as it grew with him, so he would leave it to his son, Christopher Tolkien, to edit the work from many manuscripts and bring his father\'s great vision to publishable form, so completing the literary achievement of a lifetime. This special edition presents anew this seminal first step towards mapping out the posthumous publishing of Middle-earth, and the beginning of an illustrious forty years and more than twenty books celebrating his father\'s legacy.This definitive new edition includes, by way of an introduction, a letter written by Tolkien in 1951 which provides a brilliant exposition of the earlier Ages, and for the first time in its history is presented with Tolkien\'s own paintings and drawings, which reveal the breathtaking grandeur and beauty of his vision of the First Age of Middle-earth.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Silmarillion-Illustrated-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0063280779/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.JkJ_Pc-NQvgDPVCUT9heTUYr4ePw3e71JiUgcAjNUbZVHlXIhU5rYxU4asD4qmtccJtoizWLea_bBXxZiwWLNEZG9XJPXS-K-PASkbKTP593CSV19V9AT8YZheHhxyC86i5h_6My789saOXhdHjvm-tGyE3dWRF-0ihPnFE03SP5yj_p_EE_2cf4LFAWmMgzQkuLMTe-6VWzOpfuH7rWhXrtVLQkLx5Ah2dS3GDGN2s37vXudcHOiOLuTlg5bqmN1zWThMWPzuuLkMwJ2pckDn4dmie-j2bUIVC-DLr6p_M.XEFC94e20iPvY8Nw6KgxbBCms2YAqzpsNb1-xD_ep-c&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Silmarillion+book&qid=1713337410&sr=8-1", 3.87, 134106, 1977,611),

    Book("743275012", "How to Day Trade: The Plain Truth", 29.13, "Ross Cameron ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614VQFa+fpL._SY466_.jpg", "How to Day Trade: The Plain Truth is a book of straight talk about what it really takes to become a day trader, and how to learn what you need to know.Do you think you know what day trading is really about? If so, where did you get your information? Social media is full of people claiming that they made a killing on a stock. Just as many people will warn you to stay away from day trading because they lost everything on some \"sure thing\" that went bad in a hurry.So what should you believe? How to Day Trade: The Plain Truth is the first book to talk candidly and in detail about how to become a day trader. It\'s written by me, Ross Cameron, the guy who turned $583 into more than $10 million. Though my results are not typical, they are fully verified and audited. I also have over one million subscribers who tune into my YouTube channel to watch me trade. They see both my winning trades and my losing ones. Yes, even I have days where I lose money. That\'s just the reality, and that\'s what I want to share with you.This book is unique among day trading books in three ways: First, it\'s written by someone with documented success from more than 20,000 trades. Sure there are lots of people on social media calling themselves \"day traders\" who will try to impress you with one amazing trade. Insider tip: You should only be impressed if they offer you an independently audited record of ALL their trades: the winning ones AND the losing ones.Second, of all the books for day traders, this one is unique: I clear away a lot of \"head trash\" that comes from social media, friends, and family who may have opinions but no real facts or deep experience with day trading. It addresses questions and opinions that most people have about day trading, like: \"If it is possible to day trade profitably, why haven\'t the giant trading firms taken it over and monopolized it by this point?\"\"If it\'s possible for regular people to make consistent money by day trading, then why isn\'t everyone doing it?\"\"Day trading is gambling. Nothing more, nothing less.\"\"What role does luck have in day trading?\"\"I have a hard time believing that you will tell me exactly the methods you use to trade. If you did that, wouldn\'t you lose your competitive edge?\"\"I\'m a gamer who\'s incredibly fast with the keyboard. Why can\'t I skip all the concepts and learning, and simply follow you as you trade?\"You will get specific, honest answers to all of these questions and more.The third thing that makes this book unique is I have identified 20 specific \"guardrails\" over my many years of trading. These are rules I follow, plus some I wish I knew when I was starting out. They are incredibly useful to keep in mind during the heat of trading-and it does get hot.If you\'re looking for day trading books for beginners, this is the book to get. Plus if you feel like you\'re not a beginner but your day trading is going nowhere, this could be the book to have in order to get you back on track.As important as charts and financial ratios are, those things come later. If you\'re thinking about day trading for a living, what you need to know first is whether day trading fits your personality, and how to avoid the biggest myths and mistakes that will cost you time and money.Real day trading is not anything like what you see on social media. After you read this book, you\'ll know why. You\'ll also have a solid roadmap of day trading strategies to take, if you decide to explore this amazing profession.", "https://www.amazon.sg/How-Day-Trade-Plain-Truth/dp/B0CM825Z81/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PPHEuQ6vDhTEjdAfO9FopVwSvORhVaCBkjGOdKaHtDE17gstPN6AuP1c_yiZInODVa7_bpVoC2UTB_l4Lk4vU7jzetyEogK1dJ10WdTqpT2oy9OcZApey2L6QojIVvLXhXSnLsLvUvRh3IsZ8O-Zt77BpEDOJXr7run0MjJsXFljcWou5BgC5EKaV9ZweIXpJcWI0HpqiGC-Xs9a9KvZMvlFxNpzMapZIxCm02IM3CJVwUXDF9EBr_rArFpnOvCj0Fw38ZrLJZs1rqCCkurcafi6Xt6b9a97SkJPuVW9mgE.A4HBgGafutpygoeIVPFW-qvwc1vqaWewEV5ndRM6T8g&dib_tag=se&keywords=Plain+Truth+book&qid=1713337445&sr=8-1", 3.97, 128406, 2000,616),

But that past has caught up with her. Convicted and sentenced to fifteen months at the infamous federal correctional facility in Danbury, Connecticut, the well-heeled Smith College alumna is now inmate #11187-424--one of the millions of people who disappear \"down the rabbit hole\" of the American penal system. From her first strip search to her final release, Kerman learns to navigate this strange world with its strictly enforced codes of behavior and arbitrary rules. She meets women from all walks of life, who surprise her with small tokens of generosity, hard words of wisdom, and simple acts of acceptance. Heartbreaking, hilarious, and at times enraging, Kerman\'s story offers a rare look into the lives of women in prison--why it is we lock so many away and what happens to them when they\'re there. Praise for Orange Is the New Black \"Fascinating . . . The true subject of this unforgettable book is female bonding and the ties that even bars can\'t unbind.\"--People (four stars)   \"I loved this book. It\'s a story rich with humor, pathos, and redemption. What I did not expect from this memoir was the affection, compassion, and even reverence that Piper Kerman demonstrates for all the women she encountered while she was locked away in jail.

As he describes the world we live in - a world whose future is deeply uncertain - the artist, Christophe Blain, listens and draws.Coming face to face with global warming, the unlikely duo - along with Mother Nature, Pop Eye and Jiminy Cricket, among others - create a picture of what the solution to our predicament actually looks like. Yes, we have a fossil-fuel problem, but simply switching to renewable energy won’t fix it. We can and must rethink everything: our energy supply, our economies and our whole world. They leave us with an inspiring vision of the future in which food, education, housing, transport and communities - in other words, all of us - work together and, with a few technological fixes, succeed in creating a world without end.“Masterful and unforgettable...

Those who appear to be friends are turning out to be enemies. And oddly enough, sworn enemies are also turning into friends. So begins the gripping third installment of this \"highly addictive series\" (Romantic Times), in which Zoey\'s mettle will be tested like never before. Her best friend, Stevie Rae, is undead and struggling to maintain a grip on her humanity. Zoey doesn\'t have a clue how to help her, but she does know that anything she and Stevie Rae discover must be kept secret from everyone else at the House of Night, where trust has become a rare commodity. Speaking of rare: Zoey finds herself in the very unexpected and rare position of having three boyfriends. Mix a little bloodlust into the equation and the situation has the potential to spell social disaster. Just when it seems things couldn\'t get any tougher, vampyres start turning up dead. Really dead. It looks like the People of Faith, and Zoey\'s horrid step-father in particular, are tired of living side-by-side with vampyres.

One phrase in particular anchored itself in listeners\' minds, a reminder that for all the discord and struggle to be found in our history as a nation, we have always been guided by a dogged optimism in the future, or what Obama called \"the audacity of hope.\" The Audacity of Hope is Barack Obama\'s call for a different brand of politics--a politics for those weary of bitter partisanshipand alienated by the \"endless clash of armies\" we see in congress and on the campaign trail; a politics rooted in the faith, inclusiveness, and nobility of spirit at the heart of \"our improbable experiment in democracy.\" He explores those forces--from the fear of losing to the perpetual need to raise money to the power of the media--that can stifle even the best-intentioned politician. He also writes, with surprising intimacy and self-deprecating humor, about settling in as a senator, seeking to balance the demands of public service and family life, and his own deepening religious commitment. At the heart of this book is Barack Obama\'s vision of how we can move beyond our divisions to tackle concrete problems. He examines the growing economic insecurity of American families, the racial and religious tensions within the body politic, and the transnational threats--from terrorism to pandemic--that gather beyond our shores. And he grapples with the role that faith plays in a democracy--where it is vital and where it must never intrude. Underlying his stories is a vigorous search for connection: the foundation for a radically hopeful political consensus. Only by returning to the principles that gave birth to our Constitution, Obama says, can Americans repair a political process that is broken, and restore to working order a government that has fallen dangerously out of touch with millions of ordinary Americans. Those Americans are out there, he writes--\"waiting for Republicans and Democrats to catch up with them.\"", "https://www.amazon.sg/Audacity-Hope-Thoughts-Reclaiming-American/dp/0307237699/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dF8xmTlbS5Q3BIcpsimB-KFDPvqg-A4d8QZLPAMWcvUyoZgQqfXy2Z_zhYuyOkJ0.heuQ9H3EgPg65AchqoSCnRWWmVywn0LX68l_hZObW18&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Audacity+of+Hope%3A+Thoughts+on+Reclaiming+the+American+Dream+book&qid=1713337983&sr=8-1", 3.69, 110873, 2006,690),

Then, to her amazement, the \"coolest girl in the world\" moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all--beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer\'s end they\'ve become TullyandKate. Inseparable. So begins Kristin Hannah\'s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives. From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn\'t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she\'ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she\'ll envy her famous best friend. . . . For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship--jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they\'ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test. Firefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone\'s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it\'s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It\'s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you--and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you\'ll never forget . . . one you\'ll want to pass on to your best friend.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Firefly-Lane-Kristin-Hannah/dp/0312537077/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.mGNre6p7tq624ramqrKhtFY_-conpYpbowJFLmmqado4PlmrQgJPVfpd8Ktx9mhJnRxIvzoy9Espjbd-RpV58wyXQcLAxKwkANXll-B7I9jBrfoxM32gAslvxEKrCX7fpgLWJ_xSGTyotsYhXOBmAzOptA_tRe17uHPzvECNgdBLvMDkb9bytE_xnRaKjl0v5XO_TWi9DBJx1ZHKwQDtEeELQeHbVDFgyho4j9M_tOl4lkvl4QB_ghngKwOnQMDGd3DV4bvNF7vUSqRbA0OuMvNd_weGvjFu0gvAtRj1-gg.7oF8RkA99TSKMhjwQhfmgP8hWKM01G1lxr2ZVgq7PI0&dib_tag=se&keywords=Firefly+Lane+book&qid=1713338001&sr=8-1", 4.04, 121966, 2008,692),

Hours after her parents were killed, Nazi officer Dr. Josef Mengele, forced Edie to dance for his amusement and her survival. Edie was pulled from a pile of corpses when the American troops liberated the camps in 1945. Edie spent decades struggling with flashbacks and survivor’s guilt, determined to stay silent and hide from the past. Thirty-five years after the war ended, she returned to Auschwitz and was finally able to fully heal and forgive the one person she’d been unable to forgive—herself.

A literary phenomenon soon after its release, it spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by the shockingly true story of a child’s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty\'s iconic novel focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. When sweet Regan\'s behavior turns sinister, a small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals take it upon themselves to rescue the poor girl from her unspeakable fate. Timeless and terrifying, The Exorcist is a story that has gripped the public zeitgeist for nearly half a century.Soon after its publication, The Exorcist became a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On the opening day of the film, lines of fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events, and CBS’s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark of American culture. . .and a reflection of our innermost fears.Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist continues to engross and disturb readers. Now, fifty years since its publication, it remains an unforgettable reading experience that will continue to shock and frighten a new generation of readers.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Exorcist-Novel-William-Peter-Blatty/dp/0062094351/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hdahD1GgN6FsOrmvRAaqtvv5G0pJkdGDFNIfU9t2CK8-rXuW02NvFDsSjYZ5i8WAqFJwBm2PiLobhtbaZSMuCGn83b6V14iYX1dNfuHxdUTE-_YkJM181Re6mSrEt_Y58J3AVn0GyOSUzJ21P-WjIP1Z7HLPwxMqmDYDXMvf-6HweB6gS0O5DID4r5w-2b-63IbqFjCX-errnmwJqcAtxfE21RxoTZT26kJAmUt6kZ4Y5FseBIDAVKKQscUh0y1q4mApUc-oHItY43s1qhVAd-rEepZlXap1oIe5-FBX7js.HLbc8hBVqgfqNL6EyvXonjnnt20-PijQv0fylJUiGDI&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Exorcist+book&qid=1713338331&sr=8-1", 4.14, 124467, 1971,731),

Seabiscuit was one of the most electrifying and popular attractions in sports history and the single biggest newsmaker in the world in 1938, receiving more coverage than FDR, Hitler, or Mussolini. But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit’s fortunes: Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire. When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains. Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson. Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically indolent also-ran into an American sports icon.Praise for Seabiscuit “Fascinating . . . Vivid . . . A first-rate piece of storytelling, leaving us not only with a vivid portrait of a horse but a fascinating slice of American history as well.”—The New York Times  “Engrossing . . .

For it, he turned to a key event in Roman history: Caesar’s death at the hands of friends and fellow politicians. Renaissance writers disagreed over the assassination, seeing Brutus, a leading conspirator, as either hero or villain. Shakespeare’s play keeps this debate alive. This edition includes: -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books -An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading Essay by Coppélia Kahn ​The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

Dodd becomes America\'s first ambassador to Hitler\'s Nazi Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history. A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the \"New Germany,\" she has one affair after another, including with the suprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance--and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler\'s true character and ruthless ambition. Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Göring and the expectedly charming--yet wholly sinister--Goebbels, In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Garden-Beasts-Terror-American-Hitlers/dp/030740885X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Uv2sM0cdeBo2Do4c26vYfAkyzO9Izh55AjB8_y9C_8Y._iLJmAB7Wokwtl9mFHKJQh8EOfuJUOcReHxalZ9TSvU&dib_tag=se&keywords=In+the+Garden+of+Beasts%3A+Love%2C+Terror%2C+and+an+American+Family+in+Hitler%27s+Berlin+book&qid=1713338665&sr=8-1", 3.81, 110481, 2011,771),

How else to explain the chance encounter that threw them together, allowing both to blossom? Quirky and spellbinding.” -- People It was the summer Coltrane died, the summer of love and riots, and the summer when a chance encounter in Brooklyn led two young people on a path of art, devotion, and initiation. Patti Smith would evolve as a poet and performer, and Robert Mapplethorpe would direct his highly provocative style toward photography. Bound in innocence and enthusiasm, they traversed the city from Coney Island to Forty-Second Street, and eventually to the celebrated round table of Max’s Kansas City, where the Andy Warhol contingent held court. In 1969, the pair set up camp at the Hotel Chelsea and soon entered a community of the famous and infamous, the influential artists of the day and the colorful fringe. It was a time of heightened awareness, when the worlds of poetry, rock and roll, art, and sexual politics were colliding and exploding. In this milieu, two kids made a pact to take care of each other. Scrappy, romantic, committed to create, and fueled by their mutual dreams and drives, they would prod and provide for one another during the hungry years.Just Kids begins as a love story and ends as an elegy. It serves as a salute to New York City during the late sixties and seventies and to its rich and poor, its hustlers and hellions.

Mocked and shunned for his appearance, he is pitied only by Esmerelda, a beautiful gypsy dancer to whom he becomes completely devoted. Esmerelda, however, has also attracted the attention of the sinister archdeacon Claude Frollo, and when she rejects his lecherous approaches, Frollo hatches a plot to destroy her, that only Quasimodo can prevent.

She\'s been stricken with something the old-timers call \"Milk Sickness.\"  \"My baby boy...\" she whispers before dying. Only later will the grieving Abe learn that his mother\'s fatal affliction was actually the work of a vampire. When the truth becomes known to young Lincoln, he writes in his journal, \"henceforth my life shall be one of rigorous study and devotion. I shall become a master of mind and body. And this mastery shall have but one purpose...\" Gifted with his legendary height, strength, and skill with an ax, Abe sets out on a path of vengeance that will lead him all the way to the White House.

I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.\" —Henry David ThoreauWalden (first published in 1854 as Walden; or, Life in the Woods) is a book by American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau. The text is a reflection upon the author\'s simple living in natural surroundings. The work is part personal declaration of independence, social experiment, voyage of spiritual discovery, satire, and—to some degree—a manual for self-reliance.Walden details Thoreau\'s experiences over the course of two years, two months, and two days in a cabin he built near Walden Pond amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, near Concord, Massachusetts.Thoreau makes precise scientific observations of nature as well as metaphorical and poetic uses of natural phenomena. He identifies many plants and animals by both their popular and scientific names, records in detail the color and clarity of different bodies of water, precisely dates and describes the freezing and thawing of the pond, and recounts his experiments to measure the depth and shape of the bottom of the supposedly \"bottomless\" Walden Pond.Henry David Thoreau (July 12, 1817 – May 6, 1862) was an American naturalist, essayist, poet, and philosopher.

Thanks to the financial security and material comforts provided by their father’s prosperous rickshaw business, twenty-one-year-old Pearl Chin and her younger sister, May, are having the time of their lives. Though both sisters wave off authority and tradition, they couldn’t be more different: Pearl is a Dragon sign, strong and stubborn, while May is a true Sheep, adorable and placid. Both are beautiful, modern, and carefree . . . until the day their father tells them that he has gambled away their wealth and that in order to repay his debts he must sell the girls as wives to suitors who have traveled from California to find Chinese brides. As Japanese bombs fall on their beloved city, Pearl and May set out on the journey of a lifetime, one that will take them through the Chinese countryside, in and out of the clutch of brutal soldiers, and across the Pacific to the shores of America. In Los Angeles they begin a fresh chapter, trying to find love with the strangers they have married, brushing against the seduction of Hollywood, and striving to embrace American life even as they fight against discrimination, brave Communist witch hunts, and find themselves hemmed in by Chinatown’s old ways and rules. At its heart, Shanghai Girls is a story of sisters: Pearl and May are inseparable best friends who share hopes, dreams, and a deep connection, but like sisters everywhere they also harbor petty jealousies and rivalries. They love each other, but each knows exactly where to drive the knife to hurt the other the most.

Thrown into a boarding school against his wishes, James winds up rooming with a most unlikely companion: a lanky British know-it-all named Sherlock Holmes (“Lock” to his friends). An heirloom Bible, donated by the Moriarty family more than a hundred years ago, has gone missing, and it doesn’t take long for the two to find themselves embroiled in the school-wide scandal.The school is on lockdown until it’s found, strange clues keep finding their way to James, and a secret society lurks behind it all. It’s a brave new reimagining of the Sherlock Holmes series as only master of suspense Ridley Pearson could envision.

To win Portia, Bassanio must pass a test prescribed by her father’s will, choosing correctly among three caskets or chests. If he fails, he may never marry at all. Bassanio and Portia also face a magnificent villain, the moneylender Shylock. In creating Shylock, Shakespeare seems to have shared in a widespread prejudice against Jews. Shylock would have been regarded as a villain because he was a Jew. Yet he gives such powerful expression to his alienation due to the hatred around him that, in many productions, he emerges as the hero. Portia is most remembered for her disguise as a lawyer, Balthazar, especially the speech in which she urges Shylock to show mercy that “droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven.” The authoritative edition of The Merchant of Venice from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes: -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Newly revised explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books -An up-to-date annotated guide to further reading Essay by Alexander Leggatt The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

Meanwhile, her daughter Ruth, a ghostwriter for authors of self-help books, is losing the ability to speak up for herself in front of the man she lives with. LuLing can only look on, helpless: her prickly relationship with her daughter does not make it easy to discuss such matters. In turn, Ruth has begun to suspect that something is wrong with her mother: she says so many confusing and contradictory things.Ruth decides to move in with her ailing mother, and while tending to her discovers the story LuLing wrote in Chinese, of her tumultuous life growing up in a remote mountain village known as Immortal Heart. LuLing tells of the secrets passed along by her mute nursemaid, Precious Auntie; of a cave where dragon bones are mined and where Peking Man was discovered; of the crumbling ravine known as the End of the World, where Precious Auntie\'s bones lie, and of the curse that LuLing believes she released through betrayal.

Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl. The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin\'s master has much deeper motives. Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined. Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled.

Winner of the prestigious Lincoln Prize and the inspiration for the Oscar Award winning–film Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis, directed by Steven Spielberg, and written by Tony Kushner.On May 18, 1860, William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry. Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires. It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war. We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through. This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln\'s mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation\'s history.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Team-Rivals-Political-Abraham-Lincoln/dp/0743270754/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hvfWVnrPRxEgkkNiDM9oABRqP3G5zVR97JjKb7Kq2LFa334QvND8kYfAOU49US4jN0c8qW69E-9nTSM-SBISRC7wQbhM8q2UiTDnC2Exilalisim3b2XS5LjR8Q0yULfCOZdh19oyU8xVnN9Gk9xUcnLwSOziIHXH3dV7Ps4hwjwX9mGUlF7hSt5dQFWnPJP68-aL_1f_dhvf0z7gynBw-HdbeavGswJKYml4FHLwFoKYBbsgOy1CKr1DTK9JHd5ohccsAXIv9Ss5rcNp0E1qbu6yupZxdR0fxue9sbeG-g.oAdFbZ5dzTP6QYykHibQclklpTP5MaIRErED_EhmTc8&dib_tag=se&keywords=Team+of+Rivals%3A+The+Political+Genius+of+Abraham+Lincoln+book&qid=1713339450&sr=8-1", 4.3, 102923, 2005,870),

Though I would have moments of lucidity over the coming days and weeks, I would never again be the same person ...\' Susannah Cahalan was a happy, clever, healthy twenty-four-year old. Then one day she woke up in hospital, with no memory of what had happened or how she had got there. Within weeks, she would be transformed into someone unrecognizable, descending into a state of acute psychosis, undergoing rages and convulsions, hallucinating that her father had murdered his wife; that she could control time with her mind. Everything she had taken for granted about her life, and who she was, was wiped out.This is Susannah\'s story of her terrifying descent into madness and the desperate hunt for a diagnosis, as, after dozens of tests and scans, baffled doctors concluded she should be confined in a psychiatric ward. It is also the story of how one brilliant man, Syria-born Dr Najar, finally proved - using a simple pen and paper - that Susannah\'s psychotic behaviour was caused by a rare autoimmune disease attacking her brain. His diagnosis of this little-known condition, thought to have been the real cause of devil-possessions through history, saved her life, and possibly the lives of many others. Cahalan takes readers inside this newly-discovered disease through the progress of her own harrowing journey, piecing it together using memories, journals, hospital videos and records. Written with passionate honesty and intelligence, Brain on Fire is a searingly personal yet universal book, which asks what happens when your identity is suddenly destroyed, and how you get it back.\'With eagle-eye precision and brutal honesty, Susannah Cahalan turns her journalistic gaze on herself as she bravely looks back on one of the most harrowing and unimaginable experiences one could ever face: the loss of mind, body and self ... a mesmerizing story\', Mira Bartók, New York Times bestselling author of The Memory PalaceSusannah Cahalan is a reporter on the New York Post, and the recipient of the 2010 Silurian Award of Excellence in Journalism for Feature Writing.

David\'s victory was improbable and miraculous. He shouldn\'t have won. Or should he have? In David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwellchallenges how we think about obstacles and disadvantages, offering a new interpretation of what it means to be discriminated against, or cope with a disability, or lose a parent, or attend a mediocre school, or suffer from any number of other apparent setbacks. Gladwell begins with the real story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago. From there, David and Goliath examines Northern Ireland\'s Troubles, the minds of cancer researchers and civil rights leaders, murder and the high costs of revenge, and the dynamics of successful and unsuccessful classrooms--all to demonstrate how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity.

She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later—the night before New Year’s Eve—the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John Gregory Dunne suffered a massive and fatal coronary. In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of forty years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LAX, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Center to relieve a massive hematoma.This powerful book is Didion’ s attempt to make sense of the “weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness ... about marriage and children and memory ... about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Year-Magical-Thinking-National-Winner/dp/1400078431/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.NhRjJtCuELvgdAHLRuAoFsQXyYYfAIWZnteJ6SKOvHYmorPb4ykccqbcdKF665iHKsosWgEDIXcIvCOAfwi9mgZKta62wOwe_ooa8AtCQLn5lU_MwBhLz3nPuJ3sdHMJMqbxDA1cpWbqLvKT3k06waCmVKkjUUDt0fiGS8A3QNqiRt-YjbwzjkqMN2-4qCvTXMq4rlwlaXzMopRAwzx7ZMGjErPvZcfSc4GWPj_vw9vuOTrY_NhXNjRI_U4waJMC3rkV8eRdwZfnuZO6s3f-PaYGV11r98VfMT5Az2gDNkk.b4MiCaeFspGCEfji6-9u9XinkpabtSHvaceOdr9qJsQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Year+of+Magical+Thinking+book&qid=1713340203&sr=8-1", 3.86, 94590, 2005,895),

First he visited his wife\'s grave. Then he joined the army. The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce--and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding. Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity\'s resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don\'t want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You\'ll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You\'ll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you\'ll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets. John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine--and what he will become is far stranger.

This luminous new edition continues on that important tradition while seamlessly weaving in modern touches, making it all the more indispensable for generations to come.” —Samin Nosrat, author of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat “Cooking shouldn’t just be about making a delicious dish—owning the process and enjoying the experience ought to be just as important as the meal itself. The new Joy of Cooking is a reminder that nothing can compare to gathering around the table for a home cooked meal with the people who matter most.” —Joanna Gaines, author of Magnolia Table In the nearly ninety years since Irma S. Rombauer self-published the first three thousand copies of Joy of Cooking in 1931, it has become the kitchen bible, with more than 20 million copies in print. This new edition of Joy has been thoroughly revised and expanded by Irma’s great-grandson John Becker and his wife, Megan Scott.John and Megan developed more than six hundred new recipes for this edition, tested and tweaked thousands of classic recipes, and updated every section of every chapter to reflect the latest ingredients and techniques available to today’s home cooks. Their strategy for revising this edition was the same one Irma and Marion employed: Vet, research, and improve Joy’s coverage of legacy recipes while introducing new dishes, modern cooking techniques, and comprehensive information on ingredients now available at farmers’ markets and grocery stores. You will find tried-and-true favorites like Banana Bread Cockaigne, Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Southern Corn Bread—all retested and faithfully improved—as well as new favorites like Chana Masala, Beef Rendang, Megan’s Seeded Olive Oil Granola, and Smoked Pork Shoulder. In addition to a thoroughly modernized vegetable chapter, there are many more vegan and vegetarian recipes, including Caramelized Tamarind Tempeh, Crispy Pan-Fried Tofu, Spicy Chickpea Soup, and Roasted Mushroom Burgers. Joy’s baking chapters now include gram weights for accuracy, along with a refreshed lineup of baked goods like Cannelés de Bordeaux, Rustic No-Knead Sourdough, Ciabatta, Chocolate-Walnut Babka, and Chicago-Style Deep-Dish Pizza, as well as gluten-free recipes for pizza dough and yeast breads. A new chapter on streamlined cooking explains how to economize time, money, and ingredients and avoid waste. You will learn how to use a diverse array of ingredients, from amaranth to za’atar. New techniques include low-temperature and sous vide cooking, fermentation, and cooking with both traditional and electric pressure cookers. Barbecuing, smoking, and other outdoor cooking methods are covered in even greater detail. This new edition of Joy is the perfect combination of classic recipes, new dishes, and indispensable reference information for today’s home cooks.

This is the story of Azar Nafisi’s dream and of the nightmare that made it come true. For two years before she left Iran in 1997, Nafisi gathered seven young women at her house every Thursday morning to read and discuss forbidden works of Western literature. They were all former students whom she had taught at university. Some came from conservative and religious families, others were progressive and secular; several had spent time in jail. They were shy and uncomfortable at first, unaccustomed to being asked to speak their minds, but soon they began to open up and to speak more freely, not only about the novels they were reading but also about themselves, their dreams and disappointments. Their stories intertwined with those they were reading—Pride and Prejudice, Washington Square, Daisy Miller and Lolita—their Lolita, as they imagined her in Tehran. Nafisi’s account flashes back to the early days of the revolution, when she first started teaching at the University of Tehran amid the swirl of protests and demonstrations. In those frenetic days, the students took control of the university, expelled faculty members and purged the curriculum. When a radical Islamist in Nafisi’s class questioned her decision to teach The Great Gatsby, which he saw as an immoral work that preached falsehoods of “the Great Satan,” she decided to let him put Gatsby on trial and stood as the sole witness for the defense. Azar Nafisi’s luminous tale offers a fascinating portrait of the Iran-Iraq war viewed from Tehran and gives us a rare glimpse, from the inside, of women’s lives in revolutionary Iran. It is a work of great passion and poetic beauty, written with a startlingly original voice.Praise for Reading Lolita in Tehran“Anyone who has ever belonged to a book group must read this book. Azar Nafisi takes us into the vivid lives of eight women who must meet in secret to explore the forbidden fiction of the West. It is at once a celebration of the power of the novel and a cry of outrage at the reality in which these women are trapped. The ayatollahs don’ t know it, but Nafisi is one of the heroes of the Islamic Republic.”—Geraldine Brooks, author of Nine Parts of Desire", "https://www.amazon.sg/Reading-Lolita-Tehran-Memoir-Books/dp/0812979303/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ieCGqtRgQ3qWCi8cFT2etm8OYMMRTqcmRYkUDPrB97g0GCIvToPPNfY01QUKDuL67ySxiyVfokOpI-ZuZYDopI5EQRksl5nX1PRW302TSzthun3ZArE6dYaiovnfgpmDdoo68XSGqZ9uNtbUvHf1cjjl-uDYC3scVWBHpK5Op2HDmXUPz3xJkbSKcbC-vB0JhjnDa65YEJL8Cj3R2RpzD86HNz3OVpTzUPg2VUqkZ-IZTurQesgkkU3Ub6M9Acy5gTe3iibULb2SSYz2Ue_9hKs-ygRVhHAreOCibt39OAE.VWdfiyFe4w3xH040VadA1RSPfucN0ah7FXevRARbv1k&dib_tag=se&keywords=Reading+Lolita+in+Tehran%3A+A+Memoir+in+Books+book&qid=1713340398&sr=8-1", 3.57, 94696, 2003,916),

An aunt convinces Quoyle and his two emotionally disturbed daughters to return with her to the starkly beautiful coastal landscape of their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Here, on desolate Quoyle’s Point, in a house empty except for a few mementos of the family’s unsavory past, the battered members of three generations try to cobble up new lives. Newfoundland is a country of coast and cove where the mercury rarely rises above seventy degrees, the local culinary delicacy is cod cheeks, and it’s easier to travel by boat and snowmobile than on anything with wheels. In this harsh place of cruel storms, a collapsing fishery, and chronic unemployment, the aunt sets up as a yacht upholsterer in nearby Killick-Claw, and Quoyle finds a job reporting the shipping news for the local weekly, the Gammy Bird (a paper that specializes in sexual-abuse stories and grisly photos of car accidents). As the long winter closes its jaws of ice, each of the Quoyles confronts private demons, reels from catastrophe to minor triumph—in the company of the obsequious Mavis Bangs; Diddy Shovel the strongman; drowned Herald Prowse; cane-twirling Beety; Nutbeem, who steals foreign news from the radio; a demented cousin the aunt refuses to recognize; the much-zippered Alvin Yark; silent Wavey; and old Billy Pretty, with his bag of secrets. By the time of the spring storms Quoyle has learned how to gut cod, to escape from a pickle jar, and to tie a true lover’s knot.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Shipping-News-Annie-Proulx/dp/0671510053/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EkUPnTZO1EHbestW04kXAEfN320WWrKJbwD7RaNJDiJf2Lu58-u--cE07N1co9gwV2FoVOlTdq9lhAaXhhdAFUap03CNyb9ItGzgyMUe1yYagwpERVTF7UzjQAVnOPVBmBTPT4yMExBqz5lp3EOwCgUBtvUohkyelos0tDPfGINhfkRIoUYQvfG-OKFyYPijE8VE-QLJ8_TvF4F5VXBX53itWQmy82LeNqnFo5ttxSOnxSt3_HCTGoznGBGPJmD_vASOW4KallW421xxNoBiwE1fIWfht-uU0pED6f5sqno.AHFul-QvI11epU1D3KkWdf2WtwJ2XSRtPXJD_15Af3k&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Shipping+News+book&qid=1713340434&sr=8-1", 3.83, 103151, 1993,919),

In Not That Kind of Girl,  Dunham illuminates the experiences that are part of making one\'s way in the world: falling in love, feeling alone, being ten pounds overweight despite eating only health food, having to prove yourself in a room full of men twice your age, finding true love, and most of all, having the guts to believe that your story is one that deserves to be told. \"Take My Virginity (No Really, Take It)\" is the account of Dunham\'s first time, and how her expectations of sex didn\'t quite live up to the actual event (\"No floodgate had been opened, no vault of true womanhood unlocked\"); \"Girls & Jerks\" explores her former attraction to less-than-nice guys--guys who had perfected the \"dynamic of disrespect\" she found so intriguing; \"Is This Even Real?\" is a meditation on her lifelong obsession with death and dying--what she calls her \"genetically predestined morbidity.\" And in \"I Didn\'t F*** Them, but They Yelled at Me,\" she imagines the tell-all she will write when she is eighty and past caring, able to reflect honestly on the sexism and condescension she has encountered in Hollywood, where women are \"treated like the paper thingies that protect glasses in hotel bathrooms--necessary but infinitely disposable.\"  Exuberant, moving, and keenly observed, Not That Kind of Girl is a series of dispatches from the frontlines of the struggle that is growing up. \"I\'m already predicting my future shame at thinking I had anything to offer you,\" Dunham writes. \"But if I can take what I\'ve learned and make one menial job easier for you, or prevent you from having the kind of sex where you feel you must keep your sneakers on in case you want to run away during the act, then every misstep of mine will have been worthwhile.\" Praise for Not That Kind of Girl \"The gifted Ms. Dunham not only writes with observant precision, but also brings a measure of perspective, nostalgia and an older person\'s sort of wisdom to her portrait of her (not all that much) younger self and her world. . . . As acute and heartfelt as it is funny.\"--Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times \"It\'s not Lena Dunham\'s candor that makes me gasp. Rather, it\'s her writing--which is full of surprises where you least expect them. A fine, subversive book.\"--David Sedaris \"This book should be required reading for anyone who thinks they understand the experience of being a young woman in our culture.

How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness?The Study: For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?The Standards:Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world\'s greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.The Comparisons: The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good?Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don\'t.The Findings: The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. The Hedgehog Concept: (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.“Some of the key concepts discerned in the study,” comments Jim Collins, \"fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people.”Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?", "https://www.amazon.sg/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/0066620996/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zoq7ofISwxsBwvV3ss-VOr-VtLpYDbCnGBu0N9gD6i8IS_SyrEPv4q31IiAcAMx78Sfa1OG5YAR5o7n2Q4ZzFIWvIvIjhmOxIQRMTDWkljxXB8vWbxLPtCwyNapGJEGAvpeoExpNf81Frk4Si8mI5vTTki1qBNawuL3Prck5Q3tAaAi9uIIZpkVesPn7D2qT.vaDjGeUu3pxM82I8-jiQK3e87_BEgHr2Kg2iVyH4VgY&dib_tag=se&keywords=Good+to+Great%3A+Why+Some+Companies+Make+the+Leap...+and+Others+Don%27t+book&qid=1713340567&sr=8-1", 4.04, 85277, 2001,932),

It was her early eye-opening stints in teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience that led to her hypothesis about what really drives success: not genius, but a unique combination of passion and long-term perseverance. In Grit, she takes us into the field to visit cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, teachers working in some of the toughest schools, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee.

In doing so, it provides an oblique self-portrait of the young Joyce himself. At its center lie questions of origin and source, authority and authorship, and the relationship of an artist to his family, culture, and race. Exuberantly inventive in style, the novel subtly and beautifully orchestrates the patterns of quotation and repetition instrumental in its hero’s quest to create his own character, his own language, life, and art: “to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.” This Penguin Classics edition is the definitive text, authorized by the Joyce estate and collated from all known proofs, manuscripts, and impressions to reflect the author’s original wishes.

The Gathering Storm, the twelfth novel in Jordan\'s #1 New York Times bestselling epic fantasy series, begins the story\'s dramatic conclusion as Rand al\'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. War is coming. The Dark One\'s forces are brutal and unrelenting. Rand must forge a united front, but the Seanchan remain an immediate threat, as do the Forsaken. With so many shadows swirling around him, Rand is consumed by his responsibilities, turning heartless in the eyes of his allies, and even more merciless to his enemies. Meanwhile the Seanchan march on the White Tower, where Egwene al\'Vere works to rally the disparate factions of the Aes Sedai together, even as their tyrannical leader schemes against her. Providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair, Egwene\'s fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.

Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnets, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator. Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and -- after his murder -- three more with his protégé. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since. Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo, Tiepolo, and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way, Cleopatra\'s supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost. In a masterly return to the classical sources, Stacy Schiff here boldly separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order.

Friedman ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Ch707SpIL._SY466_.jpg", "The beginning of the twenty-first century will be remembered, Friedman argues, not for military conflicts or political events, but for a whole new age of globalization – a ‘flattening’ of the world. The explosion of advanced technologies now means that suddenly knowledge pools and resources have connected all over the planet, levelling the playing field as never before, so that each of us is potentially an equal – and competitor – of the other. The rules of the game have changed forever – but does this ‘death of distance’, which requires us all to run faster in order to stay in the same place, mean the world has got too small and too flat too fast for us to adjust? Friedman brilliantly demystifies the exciting, often bewildering, global scene unfolding before our eyes, one which we sense but barely yet understand. The World is Flat is the most timely and essential update on globalization, its successes and its discontents, powerfully illuminated by a world-class writer. In his new chapters: \'If It\'s Not Happening, It\'s Because You\'re Not Doing It\' and \'What Happens When We All Have Dog\'s Hearing?\' the author explores both the benefits and disadvantages of the very latest developments in global communication. The emergent popularity of blogging, pod-casting, YouTube and MySpace enable the modern world citizen to broadcast their views to a potential audience of billions, and the proliferation of Internet access to even the poorest communities gives everyone who wants to the tools to address issues of social injustice and inequality. On the other hand the technology that seems to improve communication on a global scale causes it to deteriorate on a local scale. Identifying ours as \'The Age of Interruption\', Friedman discusses the annoyance and dangers of BlackBerrys in meeting rooms, hands-free kits in conversation and using a phone or iPod whilst driving. In an age when we are always \'connected\' via email or mobile phone how can we hope to concentrate on one thing without interruption? As expected the author has revitalised this new edition of The World Is Flat with timely insights into the nature of our flat world.", "https://www.amazon.sg/World-Flat-Globalized-Twenty-first-Century/dp/0141034890/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.XO1ibqAZMV6ldDW0l0gGOgBz7nhMZd0EW5E_4VaDXGLSedUaQsjxyOYwTQxpoaXWpSCQyyHZeDxxnTeug61L7Qn6gb4gsUT5dSR3NP3bgv4zhCODbI7TnGSNLw3nu1EunuT8atcA0Zx1kpLIXfqYQpV3UafiJ9XtfoAX2v82RZr-U_k_CtIVT7bFaVbhQxLt.7tJHpcEWLnDRFM3cV8OsmHhhz3G4-i0JE1DN3BzB090&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+World+Is+Flat%3A+A+Brief+History+of+the+Twenty-first+Century+book&qid=1713340991&sr=8-1", 3.66, 78271, 2005,969),

Romancier français, né à Nantes (sur l’île Feydeau, entre les deux bras de la Loire) qui atteignit une extraordinaire popularité avec une longue série d´œuvres combinant aventure et science-fiction, parmi lesquelles on peut citer les incontournables « Voyage au centre de la terre » (1864), « Vingt mille lieues sous les mers » (1869), les aventures du Capitaine Nemo et son équipage, ainsi que « Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours » (1873), récit du mémorable voyage de l´anglais Phileas Fogg et de son valet Passe-partout. Dans tous ses romans, il pousse jusqu\'au bout les conséquences du progrès technique.

What was his hold over them? And what was the motivation behind such savagery? In the public imagination, over time, the case assumed the proportions of myth. The murders marked the end of the sixties and became an immediate symbol of the dark underside of that era.Vincent Bugliosi was the prosecuting attorney in the Manson trial, and this book is his enthralling account of how he built his case from what a defense attorney dismissed as only \"two fingerprints and Vince Bugliosi.\" The meticulous detective work with which the story begins, the prosecutor\'s view of a complex murder trial, the reconstruction of the philosophy Manson inculcated in his fervent followers...these elements make for a true crime classic.

Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Between-World-Me-Ta-Nehisi-Coates/dp/0525510303/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kuRpylivBhrerVEYxnRjgrJxTqYEbI5f_nS0ny3tAilOQAKtH8PwgVGz3EZRZ_tgamEKA_-bF16l9DexrgPXA2UnotSluFZyhNbBdQ3DksQIm_5WrZoBdjSTyT6gGvWecOOJhQM65vqw611kuRNp7E_G1QG_6WKW6CyjM0GwP9Jz6xNN5qjmHoL2dWGVs5tQgGsDU5crkpUMYDlaiCbBFXaVQlayzsFvvZKj5_lmo_MDHT6PtXDYBYg9FtQiMtllFZWuVlo4sAMhBFYx1dof8QVm-ztWAvZzp2nGBVXvrY4.PhlEKGFFDUk6JHOmFuVvC2UYwGSqWgTZccaqL2K1rSU&dib_tag=se&keywords=Between+the+World+and+Me+book&qid=1713341104&sr=8-1", 4.4, 74218, 2015,983),

We go for the people who make the food and for the people who serve the food. We eat out to help us feel good feelings about the people we eat with. Restaurants create memories. Every page in Diner captures those feelings.\"--Carla Lalli Music, author of That Sounds So Good and Where Cooking BeginsOn New Year\'s Eve 1998, Andrew Tarlow, along with Mark Firth, opened Diner out of a repurposed dining car under the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn. Within the decade, it single-handedly became one of the city\'s most influential restaurants, giving birth to a Brooklyn mini-empire--including Marlow & Sons, Roman\'s, and Achilles Heel--and an ethos of community, sustainability, and eating local. In Diner: Day for Night, Tarlow takes us back to the restaurant that brought the farm-to-table movement to Brooklyn. Featuring evocative photography, Diner: Day for Night is a poetic homage to a lively place as the day shifts from morning to night, both intimate and welcoming. Get a glimpse of Diner\'s opening chef Caroline\'s first impression of Diner co-founders Andrew and Mark, the chaotic opening night that everyone turned up for, and the many faces that have come and gone throughout the years. The recipes are based upon the food so many have come to love and are built around each season, from Asparagus with Tahini Sauce and Wilted Frilly Mustard Greens and Green Tomatoes with Mozzarella, Basil, and Green Coriander to Lamb Belly with Potatoes and Tomatoes and Vanilla Pots De Crème.

Hapless veterans of World War II, Archie and Samad and their families become agents of England’s irrevocable transformation. A second marriage to Clara Bowden, a beautiful, albeit tooth-challenged, Jamaican half his age, quite literally gives Archie a second lease on life, and produces Irie, a knowing child whose personality doesn’t quite match her name (Jamaican for “no problem”).

You\'ve either done it or know someone who has: the one-night stand, the familiar outcome of a night spent at a bar, sometimes the sole payoff for your friend\'s irritating wedding, or the only relief from a disastrous vacation. Often embarrassing and uncomfortable, occasionally outlandish, but most times just a necessary and irresistible evil, the one-night stand is a social rite as old as sex itself and as common as a bar stool. Enter Chelsea Handler. Gorgeous, sharp, and anything but shy, Chelsea loves men and lots of them. My Horizontal Life chronicles her romp through the different bedrooms of a variety of suitors, a no-holds-barred account of what can happen between a man and a sometimes very intoxicated, outgoing woman during one night of passion. From her short fling with a Vegas stripper to her even shorter dalliance with a well-endowed little person, from her uncomfortable tryst with a cruise ship performer to her misguided rebound with a man who likes to play leather dress-up, Chelsea recalls the highs and lows of her one-night stands with hilarious honesty. Encouraged by her motley collection of friends (aka: her partners in crime) but challenged by her family members (who at times find themselves a surprise part of the encounter), Chelsea hits bottom and bounces back, unafraid to share the gritty details.

But that was before any of this happened.\"Donald Miller was raised in a strict Texas denomination where he was only vaguely familiar with a distant God. When he grew older, he ran all the way to the least-religious university in the US: Rice College in Portland, Oregon. Still, God pursued him. When he came to know Jesus, he pursued the Christian life with great zeal. However, within a few years he had a successful ministry that ultimately left him feeling empty, burned out, and, once again, far away from God.In this intimate, non-judgmental, and soul-searching account, Miller describes his remarkable journey with and back to the infinitely loving God, helping you…discover how the Christian faith is still relevant in a postmodern culture;learn how to have a genuine encounter with a God who is real; andenjoy a renewed sense of passion for your life. Blue Like Jazz is a gentle, honest resource for those curious about the Christian faith, or new to it, and offers a fresh and original perspective on life, love, and redemption.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Blue-Like-Jazz-Nonreligious-Spirituality/dp/0785263705/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gl6t0MwRevr6e5btUjLSoJ4YYY0Cnwy-RDuKy7Q88drGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.aWdX1wsTXX4lUY5Mxi-6IBtVejq_CC9etDOWfUaUm_Y&dib_tag=se&keywords=Blue+Like+Jazz%3A+Nonreligious+Thoughts+on+Christian+Spirituality+book&qid=1713341430&sr=8-1", 3.92, 82090, 2003,1025),

Though the Greek and Roman crewmembers of the Argo II have made progress in their many quests, they still seem no closer to defeating the earth mother, Gaea. Her giants have risen--all of them--and they\'re stronger than ever. They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood--the blood of Olympus--in order to wake. The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps. The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east. The gods, still suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea\'s army of powerful giants? As dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over.

We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it’s wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time. “Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?” “Should I go out with this girl even though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos? !” “My girlfriend just got a message from some dude named Nathan. Who’s Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be sure?” But the transformation of our romantic lives can’t be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet and, after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today, people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance, but for Modern Romance, the book, he decided he needed to take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzed behavioral data and surveys and created their own online research forum on Reddit, which drew thousands of messages. They enlisted the world’s leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, Helen Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, Sherry Turkle, and Robb Willer.

In this provocative story from the #1 New York Times bestselling author, “Picoult writes with unassuming brilliance” (Stephen King).Every expectant parent will tell you that they don’t want a perfect baby, just a healthy one. Charlotte and Sean O’Keefe would have asked for a healthy baby, too, if they’d been given the choice. Instead, their lives are made up of sleepless nights, mounting bills, the pitying stares of “luckier” parents, and maybe worst of all, the what-ifs. What if their child had been born healthy? But it’s all worth it because Willow is, funny as it seems, perfect. She’s smart as a whip, on her way to being as pretty as her mother, kind, brave, and for a five-year-old an unexpectedly deep source of wisdom. Willow is Willow, in sickness and in health. Everything changes, though, after a series of events forces Charlotte and her husband to confront the most serious what-ifs of all. What if Charlotte had known earlier of Willow’s illness? What if things could have been different? What if their beloved Willow had never been born? To do Willow justice, Charlotte must ask herself these questions and one more.

Who is Ruth McBride Jordan? A self-declared \"light-skinned\" woman evasive about her ethnicity, yet steadfast in her love for her twelve black children. James McBride, journalist, musician, and son, explores his mother\'s past, as well as his own upbringing and heritage, in a poignant and powerful debut, The Color Of Water: A Black Man\'s Tribute to His White Mother.The son of a black minister and a woman who would not admit she was white, James McBride grew up in \"orchestrated chaos\" with his eleven siblings in the poor, all-black projects of Red Hook, Brooklyn. \"Mommy,\" a fiercely protective woman with \"dark eyes full of pep and fire,\" herded her brood to Manhattan\'s free cultural events, sent them off on buses to the best (and mainly Jewish) schools, demanded good grades, and commanded respect. As a young man, McBride saw his mother as a source of embarrassment, worry, and confusion—and reached thirty before he began to discover the truth about her early life and long-buried pain.In The Color of Water, McBride retraces his mother\'s footsteps and, through her searing and spirited voice, recreates her remarkable story. The daughter of a failed itinerant Orthodox rabbi, she was born Rachel Shilsky (actually Ruchel Dwara Zylska) in Poland on April 1, 1921. Fleeing pogroms, her family emigrated to America and ultimately settled in Suffolk, Virginia, a small town where anti-Semitism and racial tensions ran high. With candor and immediacy, Ruth describes her parents\' loveless marriage; her fragile, handicapped mother; her cruel, sexually-abusive father; and the rest of the family and life she abandoned.At seventeen, after fleeing Virginia and settling in New York City, Ruth married a black minister and founded the all- black New Brown Memorial Baptist Church in her Red Hook living room. \"God is the color of water,\" Ruth McBride taught her children, firmly convinced that life\'s blessings and life\'s values transcend race. Twice widowed, and continually confronting overwhelming adversity and racism, Ruth\'s determination, drive and discipline saw her dozen children through college—and most through graduate school. At age 65, she herself received a degree in social work from Temple University.Interspersed throughout his mother\'s compelling narrative, McBride shares candid recollections of his own experiences as a mixed-race child of poverty, his flirtations with drugs and violence, and his eventual self- realization and professional success. The Color of Water touches readers of all colors as a vivid portrait of growing up, a haunting meditation on race and identity, and a lyrical valentine to a mother from her son.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Color-Water-Black-Tribute-Mother/dp/159448192X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.03eMlxFJwIF_ftDkRcbjpgaTwjNzFvCIYMpNEfwKsCs.NMUDBaGjijvjYqaoRJMRiNvjPgWtvmTiW3UMw97AOjs&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Color+of+Water%3A+A+Black+Man%27s+Tribute+to+His+White+Mother+book&qid=1713341783&sr=8-1", 4.06, 80906, 1996,1068),

When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death–a cryptic message on Mac’s cell phone—Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister’s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed—a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae. . . . As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister’s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future.

One day, while tidying up her garden after a storm, she found a chaffinch nest - a strange, sodden lump on the grass under a fir tree. She carried it inside and placed it on a newspaper; over the next few hours, as the water drained out of it, the sodden lump blossomed into a mossy jewel. She was amazed, and dropped everything to make a painting of the nest at exact life size.This was the start of an obsession; Ogilvy has since painted more than fifty bird nests from life, each time marvelling at its ingenious construction. Every species of bird has its own vernacular, but sources its materials - most commonly twigs, roots, grasses, reeds, leaves, moss, lichen, hair, feathers and cobwebs, less usually, mattress stuffing and string - according to local availability. Ogilvy would, of course, never disturb nesting birds; instead she relies upon serendipity, which is why all her nests have either been abandoned after fulfilling their purpose, or displaced by strong winds.Although Nests showcases the specimens she has found near her homes in Somerset and on the Isle of Arran, its subject matter is by no means only British, since these same birds can be found all over Europe, Scandinavia and as far afield as Russia, Turkey and North Africa.

My mind was warped into a new shape by her prose and it will never be the same again.\" -- Greta GerwigThe authorized, original edition of one of the great literary masterpieces of the twentieth century: a miraculous novel of family, love, war, and mortality, with a foreword from Eudora Welty. From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse, Woolf constructs a remarkable, moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life and conflict between men and women.To the Lighthouse is made up of three powerfully charged visions into the life of the Ramsay family living in a summer house off the rocky coast of Scotland. There\'s the serene and maternal Mrs. Ramsay, the tragic yet absurd Mr. Ramsay, their eight children, and assorted holiday guests. With the lighthouse excursion postponed, Woolf shows the small joys and quiet tragedies of everyday life that seemingly could go on forever.But as time winds its way through their lives, the Ramsays face, alone and together, the greatest of human challenges and its greatest triumph--the human capacity for change.A moving portrait in miniature of family life, To the Lighthouse also has profoundly universal implications, giving language to the silent space that separates people and the space that they transgress to reach each other.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Lighthouse-Virginia-Woolf/dp/0156907399/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.mzCs6hXpxFUg8d7rTLwzmQot6spJRjJhRODXQ2bjpYdYBay0grz1-dWzNAk6_wghgwZSFNSC6HsXVvTJckwP7R1dYw5JBOetXGp4GL3vmzYYf9HjzWrCXSWqEq8OsIq3eV2_NXHIHzlMsFNyjOgZVuZL3hk_FKYEDSXbBK4LPP97vgB7sDOsNDjgKDs2gB7WRTc3ixsXex9NBWy8K0jK-AGwIRJ-2sLPQiUWQHDM2sYQA9fq7HsN8v374skdbJGUw_Ig7H_qcYQtwVq7l5Vx44w7g9OJPMQMhJJFXttyKiE.fQvJWAIY3fYzJLYeE0dvwxaz_V2VxBWbyQol-hDiRTg&dib_tag=se&keywords=To+The+Lighthouse+book&qid=1713341941&sr=8-1", 3.76, 83066, 1927,1084),

Because in order to make any transformation successful, you must change more than just the structure and operations of an organizationyou need to change people’s behavior. And that is never easy.The Heart of Change is your guide to helping people think and feel differently in order to meet your shared goals. According to bestselling author and renowned leadership expert John Kotter and coauthor Dan Cohen, this focus on connecting with people’s emotions is what will spark the behavior change and actions that lead to success. Now freshly designed, The Heart of Change is the engaging and essential complement to Kotter’s worldwide bestseller Leading Change.Building off of Kotter’s revolutionary eight-step process, this book vividly illustrates how large-scale change can work. With real-life stories of people in organizations, the authors show how teams and individuals get motivated and activated to overcome obstacles to changeand produce spectacular results. Kotter and Cohen argue that change initiatives often fail because leaders rely too exclusively on data and analysis to get buy-in from their teams instead of creatively showing or doing something that appeals to their emotions and inspires them to spring into action. They call this the see-feel-change dynamic, and it is crucial for the success of any true organizational transformation.Refreshingly clear and eminently practical, The Heart of Change is required reading for anyone facing the challenges inherent in leading change.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Heart-Change-Real-Life-Stories-Organizations/dp/1422187330/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Al6hQMHucelDtLLhnh1zFYaYsU3WOXIc_qSrabzZUFjYFya17Y0F8nUBOZSAgBDHjwOrzlOoXEy5M_zEF5kctWRnZSZ0EgywZBGSovdsBIXhgSO2fD-mLY-RG06qbgoLP7uFWXiVqDRkuAm0trQusBL4XyGQ7yy7r7cBGXjHlI9uN8BeUbMKnwZgkhn-ouLHLLL6DqFNY1vEwHiJmR0e5yCx3YeGjMc_HrePIy6qRdAS-9sPv1XCW9eF2rX7gfMid_EN4f1j3CnJJg1pLo_ft-CJMQFBNwBmBDiHm6tSpx8.ktH3yVlA9srRFsYFTNxkYeT8z-qDJeO_PiBQJclvVmo&dib_tag=se&keywords=Change+of+Heart+book&qid=1713342049&sr=8-1", 3.91, 86471, 2008,1101),

You\'ve seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twentysomething guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn\'t really a request) of his employers, Augusten lands in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey Jr. are immediately dashed by grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click and that\'s when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life--and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that\'s as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is true.

Noticing a lump in her breast, she assumed it was most likely a clogged milk duct. But a biopsy revealed it was not.

It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Waterhouse and Detachment 2702—commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy\'s fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse\'s crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a \"data haven\" in Southeast Asia—a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe\'s tough-as-nails granddaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn.A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson\'s most accomplished and affecting work to date, Cryptonomicon is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow.

How did one of the poorest teams in baseball win so many games?In a quest to discover the answer, Michael Lewis delivers not only “the single most influential baseball book ever” (Rob Neyer, Slate) but also what “may be the best book ever written on business” (Weekly Standard). Lewis first looks to all the logical places―the front offices of major league teams, the coaches, the minds of brilliant players―but discovers the real jackpot is a cache of numbers?numbers! ?collected over the years by a strange brotherhood of amateur baseball enthusiasts: software engineers, statisticians, Wall Street analysts, lawyers, and physics professors.What these numbers prove is that the traditional yardsticks of success for players and teams are fatally flawed. Even the box score misleads us by ignoring the crucial importance of the humble base-on-balls. This information had been around for years, and nobody inside Major League Baseball paid it any mind. And then came Billy Beane, general manager of the Oakland Athletics. He paid attention to those numbers?with the second-lowest payroll in baseball at his disposal he had to?to conduct an astonishing experiment in finding and fielding a team that nobody else wanted.In a narrative full of fabulous characters and brilliant excursions into the unexpected, Michael Lewis shows us how and why the new baseball knowledge works.

In a moment of levity during the season\'s first snowfall, they build a child out of snow. The next morning the snow child is gone -- but they glimpse a young, blonde-haired girl running through the trees. This little girl, who calls herself Faina, seems to be a child of the woods. She hunts with a red fox at her side, skims lightly across the snow, and somehow survives alone in the Alaskan wilderness.

When Grandpa E. Rucker Blakeslee announces one July morning in 1906 that he\'s aiming to marry the young and freckledy milliner, Miss Love Simpson—a bare three weeks after Granny Blakeslee has gone to her reward—the news is served up all over town with that afternoon\'s dinner. And young Will Tweedy suddenly finds himself eyewitness to a major scandal. Boggled by the sheer audacity of it all, and not a little jealous of his grandpa\'s new wife, Will nevertheless approves of this May-December match and follows its progress with just a smidgen of youthful prurience. As the newlyweds\' chaperone, conspirator, and confidant, Will is privy to his one-armed, renegade grandfather\'s second adolescence; meanwhile, he does some growing up of his own. He gets run over by a train and lives to tell about it; he kisses his first girl, and survives that too. Olive Ann Burns has given us a timeless, funny, resplendent novel - about a romance that rocks an entire town, about a boy\'s passage through the momentous but elusive year when childhood melts into adolescence, and about just how people lived and died in a small Southern town at the turn of the century.

This Penguin Modern Classics edition includes a new introduction by Robert Bray.Abandoned by her husband, Amanda Wingfield comforts herself with recollections of her earlier, more gracious life in Blue Mountain when she was pursued by \'gentleman callers\'. Her son Tom, a poet with a job in a warehouse, longs for adventure and escape from his mother\'s suffocating embrace, while Laura, her shy crippled daughter, has her glass menagerie and her memories. Amanda is desperate to find her daughter a husband, but when the long-awaited gentleman caller does arrive, Laura\'s romantic illusions are crushed.Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) was born in Columbus, Mississippi. When his father, a travelling salesman, moved with his family to St Louis some years later, both he and his sister found it impossible to settle down to city life. He entered college during the Depression and left after a couple of years to take a clerical job in a shoe company. He stayed there for two years, spending the evenings writing. He received a Rockefeller Fellowship in 1940 for his play Battle of Angels, and he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 and 1955. Among his many other plays Penguin have published The Glass Menagerie (1944), A Streetcar Named Desire (1947), The Rose Tattoo (1951), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955), Sweet Bird of Youth (1959), The Night of the Iguana (1961), and Small Craft Warnings (1972).If you enjoyed The Glass Menagerie, you might like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.\'Tennessee Williams will live as long as drama itself\'Peter Shaffer, author of Equus", "https://www.amazon.sg/Glass-Menagerie-Tennessee-Williams/dp/0141190264/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qdKuVR1i3ov3OFA4EaPaBPmoJNcHmEEou-UV-LYh6kqRsecw0Tg7F9bWOMr2SXeIb013MtGaYOXIr8OsE9rrPHw8cYMfSDMPusj7dsm7WHPjvFP2jlywTuwQE9m054OTWfZWiXivwXfl7rt3WZSZC281rHVOJpCZrGGJtAU9L-Rz5uOmACRLFqBqEeUGM0Oo3YmeFeegwD6nPEp5ke-_a9INyJgS0xvH4aF4O2oP7Fq47egSqWCYylfxTUjPEeuGFtzSfbKt8Hu4aEgK36nWz43CQ9l9vVBCqxxkSSDTs5o.V1TRtCFIahwl4JpGvZf4iaiqP7I4j90WIzVn9kjzzRs&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Glass+Menagerie+book&qid=1713789929&sr=8-1", 3.67, 90032, 1945,1186),

Kelsier, Vin, Elend, Sazed, Spook, and the rest are now part of history--or religion. Yet even as science and technology are reaching new heights, the old magics of Allomancy and Feruchemy continue to play a role in this reborn world. Out in the frontier lands known as the Roughs, they are crucial tools for the brave men and women attempting to establish order and justice. One such is Waxillium Ladrian, a rare Twinborn, who can Push on metals with his Allomancy and use Feruchemy to become lighter or heavier at will. After twenty years in the Roughs, Wax has been forced by family tragedy to return to the metropolis of Elendel. Now he must reluctantly put away his guns and assume the duties and dignity incumbent upon the head of a noble house. Or so he thinks, until he learns the hard way that the mansions and elegant tree-lined streets of the city can be even more dangerous than the dusty plains of the Roughs.

Abdul, an enterprising teenager, sees “a fortune beyond counting” in the recyclable garbage that richer people throw away. Meanwhile Asha, a woman of formidable ambition, has identified a shadier route to the middle class. With a little luck, her beautiful daughter, Annawadi’s “most-everything girl,” might become its first female college graduate. And even the poorest children, like the young thief Kalu, feel themselves inching closer to their dreams. But then Abdul is falsely accused in a shocking tragedy; terror and global recession rock the city; and suppressed tensions over religion, caste, sex, power, and economic envy turn brutal. With intelligence, humor, and deep insight into what connects people to one another in an era of tumultuous change, Behind the Beautiful Forevers, based on years of uncompromising reporting, carries the reader headlong into one of the twenty-first century’s hidden worlds—and into the hearts of families impossible to forget.

This celebrated classic has been shared by generations of readers and listeners, a must-have for every child’s bookshelf and a perfect gift for the holiday season. New York Public Library\'s #1 book on the list of “Top Check Outs of All Time” In 1962, a little boy named Peter put on his snowsuit and stepped out of his house and into the hearts of millions of readers. Universal in its appeal, this story beautifully depicts a child\'s wonder at a new world, and the hope of capturing and keeping that wonder forever. The quiet fun and sweetness of Peter’s small adventures in the deep, deep snow is perfect for reading together on a cozy winter day. Ezra Jack Keats was also the creator of such classics as Goggles, A Letter to Amy, Pet Show!, Peter’s Chair, and A Whistle for Willie. (This book is also available in Spanish, as Un dia de nieve.) Praise for The Snowy Day: “Keats made Peter’s world so inviting that it beckons us. Perhaps the busyness of daily life in the 21st century makes us appreciate Peter even more—a kid who has the luxury of a whole day to just be outside, surrounded by snow that’s begging to be enjoyed.” —The Atlantic \"Ezra Jack Keats\'s classic The Snowy Day, winner of the 1963 Caldecott Medal, pays homage to the wonder and pure pleasure a child experiences when the world is blanketed in snow.\"—Publisher\'s Weekly", "https://www.amazon.sg/Snowy-Day-Ezra-Jack-Keats/dp/0140501827/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DzPQmsHh4joZZE7PGUgke2TPLMxTBLMYIFcsSdLYYh54ZUmACNYbnOnk6z-bb61MpdftE6U_swPCvRD-fD8NNu55-1SIQcFpZs1T8Am2DPk07-h2jFPigq2pcqB0zSl-JkXQSjaFrwZ3pXrsfHDcRB499odRgRAOPqB51MbvFhAdSXGGL_D4BejXUB1e-QEg9Wajagy1TF5IE2U08VMmb6JvzbauQnJXRyFM_VhIdyL3gMgtO03dJixXzLIgouF7fV5PMmtI210cKG91Zgz32IRikHps0Fwy7K9vnvwM_rw.JDNeUKs2RS8dtJKpWy95Hf5x3W5eM0CGCdtY6itBfls&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Snowy+Day+book&qid=1713791008&sr=8-1", 4.13, 81914, 1962,1266),

Caro ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61WvKcckCnL._SY466_.jpg", "PULITZER PRIZE WINNER   • A modern American classic, this huge and galvanizing biography of Robert Moses reveals not only the saga of one man’s incredible accumulation of power but the story of his shaping (and mis-shaping) of twentieth-century New York. One of the Modern Library’s hundred greatest books of the twentieth century, Robert Caro\'s monumental book makes public what few outsiders knew: that Robert Moses was the single most powerful man of his time in the City and in the State of New York. And in telling the Moses story, Caro both opens up to an unprecedented degree the way in which politics really happens—the way things really get done in America\'s City Halls and Statehouses—and brings to light a bonanza of vital information about such national figures as Alfred E. Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt (and the genesis of their blood feud), about Fiorello La Guardia, John V. Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller. But The Power Broker is first and foremost a brilliant multidimensional portrait of a man—an extraordinary man who, denied power within the normal framework of the democratic process, stepped outside that framework to grasp power sufficient to shape a great city and to hold sway over the very texture of millions of lives. We see how Moses began: the handsome, intellectual young heir to the world of Our Crowd, an idealist. How, rebuffed by the entrenched political establishment, he fought for the power to accomplish his ideals. How he first created a miraculous flowering of parks and parkways, playlands and beaches—and then ultimately brought down on the city the smog-choked aridity of our urban landscape, the endless miles of (never sufficient) highway, the hopeless sprawl of Long Island, the massive failures of public housing, and countless other barriers to humane living. How, inevitably, the accumulation of power became an end in itself. Moses built an empire and lived like an emperor. He was held in fear—his dossiers could disgorge the dark secret of anyone who opposed him. He was, he claimed, above politics, above deals; and through decade after decade, the newspapers and the public believed. Meanwhile, he was developing his public authorities into a fourth branch of government known as \"Triborough\"—a government whose records were closed to the public, whose policies and plans were decided not by voters or elected officials but solely by Moses—an immense economic force directing pressure on labor unions, on banks, on all the city\'s political and economic institutions, and on the press, and on the Church. He doled out millions of dollars\' worth of legal fees, insurance commissions, lucrative contracts on the basis of who could best pay him back in the only coin he coveted: power. He dominated the politics and politicians of his time—without ever having been elected to any office. He was, in essence, above our democratic system. Robert Moses held power in the state for 44 years, through the governorships of Smith, Roosevelt, Lehman, Dewey, Harriman and Rockefeller, and in the city for 34 years, through the mayoralties of La Guardia, O\'Dwyer, Impellitteri, Wagner and Lindsay, He personally conceived and carried through public works costing 27 billion dollars—he was undoubtedly America\'s greatest builder. This is how he built and dominated New York—before, finally, he was stripped of his reputation (by the press) and his power (by Nelson Rockefeller). But his work, and his will, had been done.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Power-Broker-Robert-Moses-Fall/dp/0394720245/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0hU0xC7cmj7Nr-Dynn6CvI3KokHa98wnOemuf71-wTHdx29fSwcldDBpm0MNGjv3YoAwK9pCdhNJPMqHrMo3xdTeVhrUXqYbHdeIeYF8L0I2JAiMuZwxRAQbWnS3vLgGRYPq0Ifq0XZNV4hMLiZZwLxsswQNIm9lfvJngkBVDZiQ_a8CiPfXJV8wISJpAwSsi45CnUM4TuSrpIiOJxn-FxSMukJD3Li9kLw1-i2BivgGVw3zYve85_EDf652-0rm-9kYGiA5dq3xvsbISlXGsXdxg6ylR1B57wDj9FOTFzU.43V7mI3kfbz9hK1eCimjt31nebCnZdTCIBF0E99lD-s&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Broker+book&qid=1713791251&sr=8-1", 3.77, 65428, 2005,1301),

Scott Peck, the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of the classic bestseller The Road Less Traveled, celebrated by The Washington Post as “not just a book but a spontaneous act of generosity.”Perhaps no book in this generation has had a more profound impact on our intellectual and spiritual lives than The Road Less Traveled. With sales of more than seven million copies in the United States and Canada, and translations into more than twenty-three languages, it has made publishing history, with more than ten years on the New York Times bestseller list. Written in a voice that is timeless in its message of understanding, The Road Less Traveled continues to help us explore the very nature of loving relationships and leads us toward a new serenity and fullness of life. It helps us learn how to distinguish dependency from love; how to become a more sensitive parent; and ultimately how to become one’s own true self. Recognizing that, as in the famous opening line of his book, “Life is difficult” and that the journey to spiritual growth is a long one, Dr. Peck never bullies his readers, but rather guides them gently through the hard and often painful process of change toward a higher level of self-understanding.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Road-Less-Traveled-Timeless-Traditional/dp/0743243153/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.BTlV55F9XCecpOhXjLPb8zmFC5bQFOavZs1MeWvDg2vcP7Ir0qnHM7YDiAuVmCNm.LYKczzyyINPBfLhH8_bbdoeuyo4xXOCfY7lTIfQ9ccM&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Road+Less+Traveled%3A+A+New+Psychology+of+Love%2C+Traditional+Values%2C+and+Spiritual+Growth+book&qid=1713791270&sr=8-1", 4.03, 61238, 1978,1303),

Featuring a foreword from Tom Hanks.They came together, citizen soldiers, in the summer of 1942, drawn to Airborne by the $50 monthly bonus and a desire to be better than the other guy. And at its peak—in Holland and the Ardennes—Easy Company was as good a rifle company as any in the world.From the rigorous training in Georgia in 1942 to the disbanding in 1945, Stephen E. Ambrose tells the story of this remarkable company. In combat, the reward for a job well done is the next tough assignment, and as they advanced through Europe, the men of Easy kept getting the tough assignments.They parachuted into France early D-Day morning and knocked out a battery of four 105 mm cannon looking down Utah Beach; they parachuted into Holland during the Arnhem campaign; they were the Battered Bastards of the Bastion of Bastogne, brought in to hold the line, although surrounded, in the Battle of the Bulge; and then they spearheaded the counteroffensive. Finally, they captured Hitler\'s Bavarian outpost, his Eagle\'s Nest at Berchtesgaden.They were rough-and-ready guys, battered by the Depression, mistrustful and suspicious. They drank too much French wine, looted too many German cameras and watches, and fought too often with other GIs. But in training and combat they learned selflessness and found the closest brotherhood they ever knew. They discovered that in war, men who loved life would give their lives for them. This is the story of the men who fought, of the martinet they hated who trained them well, and of the captain they loved who led them.

This Penguin Classics edition contains an introduction and notes by William Bynum, and features a cover designed by Damien Hirst.Written for a general readership, On the Origin of Species sold out on the day of its publication and has remained in print ever since. Instantly and persistently controversial, the concept of natural selection transformed scientific analysis about all life on Earth. Before the Origin of Species, accepted thinking held that life was the static and perfect creation of God. By a single, systematic argument Darwin called this view into question. His ideas have affected public perception of everything from religion to economics.William Bynum\'s introduction discusses Darwin\'s life, the publication and reception of the themes of On the Origin of Species, and the subsequent development of its major themes. The new edition also includes brief biographies of some of the most important scientific thinkers leading up to and surrounding the Origin of Species, suggested further reading, notes and a chronology. Charles Darwin (1809-82), a Victorian scientist and naturalist, has become one of the most famous figures of science to date.

MartinOn May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the era\'s great transatlantic \"Greyhounds\"--the fastest liner then in service--and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwieger\'s U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly small--hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and more--all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but don\'t, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history.

It came to be associated with the group of writers known as the Beat Generation, which included Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs. There is no foundation to the myth that \"Howl\" was written as a performance piece and later published by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti of City Lights Books. This myth was perpetuated by Ferlinghetti as part of the defense\'s case during the poem\'s obscenity trial, as detailed below. Upon the poem\'s release, Ferlinghetti and the bookstore\'s manager, Shigeyoshi Murao, were charged with disseminating obscene literature, and both were arrested. On October 3, 1957, Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that the poem was not obscene.

It is a record of God\'s dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fullness of the everlasting gospel. The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians. The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come. After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, the a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language. In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Sone of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved", "https://www.amazon.sg/Book-Mormon-Another-Testament-Official/dp/0967686563/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.rE8mu2RxBL1TUTHnHn-jlVy9Qv5EJJNYKCfj3vUQC40FoTfrFGDNcBa4ATI5RyBsJkL8uKK3DuN0c0swFa_aib-GSUKD9cSR0JCkB8Txq4DO7f0Oi201TmUZM3d6yL7XJvY66prdDA6ew-W74T4xonGI3Eeeq7xazsT3qA6BueXLqqjghnJbcMVUl2XTLHk5na9Q7HlkrKI31MYXwV09Cgv7h5oAcwChjfBaStDkf7lw7yxBg2k7WgjyCbFYALX2DQbgc8xYkrhrDU7MFFw-h0EWGRpynWSj1EV3hKh_KOQ.wt3qQS-M6k_ExHutLtiwgX3E5Djv0bHapx4myGrr-Bs&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Book+of+Mormon+book&qid=1713791555&sr=8-1", 4.37, 63530, 1830,1338),

What is the difference between choking and panicking? Why are there dozens of varieties of mustard-but only one variety of ketchup? What do football players teach us about how to hire teachers? What does hair dye tell us about the history of the 20th century? In the past decade, Malcolm Gladwell has written three books that have radically changed how we understand our world and ourselves:  The Tipping Point; Blink; and Outliers. Now, in What the Dog Saw, he brings together, for the first time, the best of his writing from TheNew Yorker over the same period. Here is the bittersweet tale of the inventor of the birth control pill, and the dazzling inventions of the pasta sauce pioneer Howard Moscowitz. Gladwell sits with Ron Popeil, the king of the American kitchen, as he sells rotisserie ovens, and divines the secrets of Cesar Millan, the \"dog whisperer\" who can calm savage animals with the touch of his hand. He explores intelligence tests and ethnic profiling and \"hindsight bias\" and why it was that everyone in Silicon Valley once tripped over themselves to hire the same college graduate. \"Good writing,\" Gladwell says in his preface, \"does not succeed or fail on the strength of its ability to persuade. It succeeds or fails on the strength of its ability to engage you, to make you think, to give you a glimpse into someone else\'s head.\" What the Dog Saw is yet another example of the buoyant spirit and unflagging curiosity that have made Malcolm Gladwell our most brilliant investigator of the hidden extraordinary.", "https://www.amazon.sg/What-Dog-Saw-Other-Adventures/dp/0316076201/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7RX-j2aGYaPpiT1bOOv5AXeTV1IVNXccPL_z3HwMTi9WeyOoc9bgE7gD5B3dEbxs3YhJkW0k6lbkS0rr-ULcA2cDSV__kMkSb4o4Kvm1V5dge93oQGaMN2eAx-MvbvftLB_rdnBW46oTYbL6jXVVZA8JXhcuzpsFISNCrpA7l8NdjEr_OsrbQ-yJA4GaNhtpsj7YuujPZnfw0000rUbKsNbDZLGoz3FKmNVgee-EqM84KcugRLtLFBUfgPNxCqCnwBOl8DxIvBIzFQ0Ur3tiYLu6yupZxdR0fxue9sbeG-g.G5gsR_aIG2heq0wTfGmL7qH5c9Qu9Zy7cFS4T1DtxYA&dib_tag=se&keywords=What+the+Dog+Saw+and+Other+Adventures+book&qid=1713791678&sr=8-1", 3.82, 65277, 2009,1344),

With an exhaustive knowledge of popular culture and an almost effortless ability to spin brilliant prose out of unlikely subject matter, Klosterman attacks the entire spectrum of postmodern America: reality TV, Internet porn, Pamela Anderson, literary Jesus freaks, and the real difference between apples and oranges (of which there is ). And don’t even get him started on his love life and the whole Harry-Met-Sally situation. Whether deconstructing Saved by the Bell episodes or the artistic legacy of Billy Joel, the symbolic importance of The Empire Strikes Back or the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, Chuck will make you think, he’ll make you laugh, and he’ll drive you insane—usually all at once. Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs is ostensibly about art, entertainment, infotainment, sports, politics, and kittens, but—really—it’s about us. All of us.

It tells the story of Charles Ryder\'s infatuation with the Marchmains and the rapidly disappearing world of privilege they inhabit. Enchanted first by Sebastian Flyte at Oxford, then by his doomed Catholic family, in particular his remote sister, Julia, Charles comes finally to recognise his spiritual and social distance from them.Evelyn Waugh (1903-66) was born in Hampstead, second son of Arthur Waugh, publisher and literary critic, and brother of Alec Waugh, the popular novelist. In 1928 he published his first work, a life of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and his first novel, Decline and Fall, which was soon followed by Vile Bodies (1930), A Handful of Dust (1934) and Scoop (1938). In 1939 he was commissioned in the Royal Marines and later transferred to the Royal Horse Guards, serving in the Middle East and in Yugoslavia. In 1942 he published Put Out More Flags and then in 1945 Brideshead Revisited. Men at Arms (1952) was the first volume of \'The Sword of Honour\' trilogy, and won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize; the other volumes, Officers and Gentlemen and Unconditional Surrender, followed in 1955 and 1961.If you enjoyed Brideshead Revisited, you might like Waugh\'s Vile Bodies, also available in Penguin Classics.\'Lush and evocative ...

Dragonlance is a shared universe of popular fantasy novels. The Hickmans conceived Dragonlance while driving in their car on the way to a job interview. At TSR Tracy met Margaret Weis, his future writing partner, and they gathered a group of associates to play the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. The adventures during that game inspired a series of gaming modules, a series of novels, licensed products such as board games, and lead miniature figures. In 1984, TSR published the first Dragonlance novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight. It began the Chronicles trilogy, a core element of the Dragonlance world. The fictional Dragonlance world of Krynn contains numerous characters, an extensive timeline, and a detailed geography. The history of Krynn consists of five ages. The novels are primarily set in the fourth age, The Age of Despair. Since February 2009, the fifth age, the Age of Mortals, has been used. The Heroes of the Lance, created by Weis and Hickman, are the popular protagonists of the Chronicles trilogy. Along with the world of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance is one of the most popular shared worlds in fiction. The majority of the novels take place in the various regions of Ansalon, a small continent, though some have taken place on the continent of Taladas, located northeast of Ansalon.

Then Aria meets an Outsider named Perry. He\'s wild—a savage—and her only hope of staying alive.

At first, Lo’s stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for—and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo’s desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong… With surprising twists, spine-tingling turns, and a setting that proves as uncomfortably claustrophobic as it is eerily beautiful, Ruth Ware offers up another taut and intense read in The Woman in Cabin 10—one that will leave even the most sure-footed reader restlessly uneasy long after the last page is turned.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Woman-Cabin-10-Ruth-Ware/dp/1501132954/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.RAuWyvifuFLu8f5OECdyVOmS8SwU_K6qI6KpGCCezxSuBb5QNUdL9kjV53eFE-Vx3Ge2mQLRSmUfL6top3jPVYme00W-1qajsyEDVu70SfsUTpt0192k7TOH2UBkPPvmDwLq5XgZcbJdkH0KlnmpZCLk3le1ZZVhuZLkAJXbdOWEjUfuSV0IG2rDHxZtW0Zq8KqFMx6pvMKbFxdePr74RczaHUfS7A_u8_5S28m4pz1tslPjK7CpXd0ebYPTh8zBYTvgHNXUmHH5AiLZGWPQ5sl9PIRMPM4c5u2wkOyxW_4.p9mqS-uEONuXB6VPltJbTGMyFaIuDeNrFBJF3kI-7qg&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Woman+in+Cabin+10+book&qid=1713792243&sr=8-1", 3.67, 90541, 2016,1433),

There simply comes a time in our lives--not fundamentally different from the way puberty separates childhood from adulthood--when it\'s time for one part of ourselves to die and for something new to be born. The purpose of this book by best-selling author and lecturer Marianne Williamson is to psychologically and spiritually reframe this transition so that it leads to a wonderful sense of joy and awakening.In our ability to rethink our lives lies our greatest power to change them. What we have called \"middle age\" need not be seen as a turning point toward death. It can be viewed as a magical turning point toward life as we\'ve never known it, if we allow ourselves the power of an independent imagination, utilizing thought-forms that don\'t simply flow in a perfunctory manner from ancient assumptions handed down to us, but rather flower into new archetypal images of a humanity just getting started at 45 or 50. What we\'ve learned by that time, from both our failures as well as our successes, tends to have humbled us into purity.When we were young, we had energy but were clueless about what to do with it. Today, we have less energy, perhaps, but we have far more understanding of what each breath of life is for. And now at last, we have a destiny to fulfill--not a destiny of a life that\'s simply over, but rather a destiny of a life that is finally truly lived. Midlife is not a crisis; it\'s a time of rebirth. It\'s not a time to accept your death; it\'s a time to accept your life--and to finally, truly live it, as you and you alone know deep in your heart it was meant to be lived.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Age-Miracles-Embracing-New-Midlife/dp/1401917208/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kwYc68l1NJOaarmFXBGX7tWI6thwdrJoz__7rNfNzvqVjn_oSrMwT317QsGPdWAS0s-CB_tC9KnclMwtKCv_TIM3z9mwmSBKf-8KyqMMr_HmxxeRQBZStCJUq_XhJCwSM_QyFFv_siSvVJev0S6Sxghlnw2P-EvIDuvHdhd3BiTpbSPd6mGbiv0YID0BD9DedIIIGGrxbor_gc84IYXJiwmmCjiXhGt9tIG_uBflZMNwO_4PXRCf2tMdy5EuZRAZSn4IGYRyjM0gsPalqg_NPI4QFEx17_m2HKpl8nULcZg.giuPR4kHpoylgJ_OfvkJTBTpuL3f1KygeIaFcbHy4wc&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Age+of+Miracles+book&qid=1713792292&sr=8-1", 3.64, 61296, 2012,1439),

In Have a Little Faith, Mitch Albom offers a beautifully written story of a remarkable eight-year journey between two worlds -- two men, two faiths, two communities -- that will inspire readers everywhere. Albom\'s first nonfiction book since Tuesdays with Morrie, Have a Little Faith begins with an unusual request: an eighty-two-year-old rabbi from Albom\'s old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy. Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he\'d left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor -- a reformed drug dealer and convict -- who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Albom observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat. As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Albom and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers, and histories are different, Albom begins to recognize a striking unity between the two worlds -- and indeed, between beliefs everywhere. In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor\'s wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the rabbi\'s last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself. Have a Little Faith is a book about a life\'s purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man\'s journey, but it is everyone\'s story. Ten percent of the profits from this book will go to charity, including The Hole In The Roof Foundation, which helps refurbish places of worship that aid the homeless.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Have-Little-Faith-True-Story/dp/140131046X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.pgmdOXIyrxYh00D0c2akzW6IvVDu3BSSQNSX1lz0cYynzMbPZ8NP1-uQycREaR_Z2XjN1nzmstinBwAaR0ZM178n6Q6gts7skWY5zuTKj_pVg3qt1hn3Fo8uHOlI4rIPnApKkqwVdr96t_L_cvV0Ueu6hCDE5ISAV9zUonrOowkwRDsNosJQ5wNz_KX3p-4cJLhRtYMZr9KDG491Gbjw6a0gTL1NVD3dYh5LQkPaCLbWXNghpRNghpiJsC75G3kjT4-3oTz8jHw_cr97NsTdlBMulP39DRy81NOKgaC4JIw.oUsCa-A0MlI2tR2JN0CuBb-wGC7uiOamTR8CUch1JPc&dib_tag=se&keywords=Have+a+Little+Faith%3A+A+True+Story+book&qid=1713792301&sr=8-1", 4.16, 60002, 2009,1440),

Satrapi evokes herself and her schoolmates coming of age in a world of protests and disappearances.... A stark, shocking impact.” —The New York Times: \"The 50 Best Memoirs of the Past 50 Years\"In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the coming-of-age story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah’s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran’s last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country.Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane’s child’s-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, with laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Persepolis-Story-Childhood-Marjane-Satrapi/dp/037571457X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wxlF-a_sujIpqm_vp8M1Lc_98wQ45nufHUla_MSiHkj7L4epqhErM6ikr62roo3nw7JScPIbn_aPzmYwNyGfK9gymixhMN8L1G4e_iShj0v-J7llSQrUsqX1XgLRpdz7iGIwJ7RZ1B0VUA61I4XHLocZgGfyQjspgxO1ejH6NgiDQ8UeG74siCXL79oCZTRYUU9-9XOFxPNT3bBJZEiTFLGWVFR_BXJbuIoFDtHdSjAZPxanO2dk9Ky3tvVFudiw_UBlYW9G2CIOKIED0SNo28oVLUjJC4jWDGjP93la12U.SbcwupCo8gyYC0rg1jaGq9zIZmf1ESt1Grp_L3IGNp8&dib_tag=se&keywords=Persepolis+book&qid=1713792475&sr=8-1", 4.36, 71353, 2003,1464),

An unforgettable novel about a young Jewish woman growing up in Boston in the early twentieth century, told \"with humor and optimism...through the eyes of an irresistible heroine\" (People)--from the acclaimed author of The Red Tent.Anita Diamant\'s \"vivid, affectionate portrait of American womanhood\" (Los Angeles Times), follows the life of one woman, Addie Baum, through a period of dramatic change. Addie is The Boston Girl, the spirited daughter of an immigrant Jewish family, born in 1900 to parents who were unprepared for America and its effect on their three daughters. Growing up in the North End of Boston, then a teeming multicultural neighborhood, Addie\'s intelligence and curiosity take her to a world her parents can\'t imagine--a world of short skirts, movies, celebrity culture, and new opportunities for women. Addie wants to finish high school and dreams of going to college. She wants a career and to find true love. From the one-room tenement apartment she shared with her parents and two sisters, to the library group for girls she joins at a neighborhood settlement house, to her first, disastrous love affair, to finding the love of her life, eighty-five-year-old Addie recounts her adventures with humor and compassion for the naïve girl she once was. Written with the same attention to historical detail and emotional resonance that made Diamant\'s previous novels bestsellers, The Boston Girl is a moving portrait of one woman\'s complicated life in twentieth century America, and a fascinating look at a generation of women finding their places in a changing world. \"Diamant brings to life a piece of feminism\'s forgotten history\" (Good Housekeeping) in this \"inspirational...page-turning portrait of immigrant life in the early twentieth century\" (Booklist).", "https://www.amazon.sg/Boston-Girl-Novel-Anita-Diamant/dp/1439199361/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.X9fTAS0LaSInz730GAC8nTlTaIj-b1YQ6nP6mnNIfs5gkcOgfq0hIfg6fIW9zpDT7BQqxnYE-mlYrmle3D-YkoPwY0h3o0IV6DqaBkuAe6t838GXGPGAdVZUV-Vod8erYSAITZf3-uexBxleZkEiPuopsGhLaSO-ektWq6-6qyrdpZoUYKjb9cGwd-6OVN_x5kaaSA4CsQUeTgfs1-1bbVSg0mk7VD_tagIG8btRKnDG4zFK6TeVS19mzjMby9zEKePANp84-Td9nCJBWqD7QhRNxGZJN313kGsu0azbEak.WFTbHcvniRVHf4G1qJePK2gaCYsDsvGRSNV6SCC4r08&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Boston+Girl+book&qid=1713792675&sr=8-1", 3.79, 51603, 2014,1482),

Raised in a strict Muslim family, Hirsi Ali survived civil war, female mutilation, brutal beatings, adolescence as a devout believer during the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, and life in four troubled, unstable countries ruled largely by despots. She escaped from a forced marriage and sought asylum in the Netherlands, where she earned a college degree in political science, tried to help her tragically depressed sister adjust to the West, and fought for the rights of Muslim women and the reform of Islam as a member of Parliament. Under constant threat, demonized by reactionary Islamists and politicians, disowned by her father, and expelled from family and clan, she refuses to be silenced. Ultimately a celebration of triumph over adversity, Hirsi Ali’s story tells how a bright little girl evolves out of dutiful obedience to become an outspoken, pioneering freedom fighter.

The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.’s grandparents were “dirt poor and in love,” and moved north from Kentucky’s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that J.D.\'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300555/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lh5PFiocvrWlgYe4OfgedgLY9PFA8jag4t1uKBm-WkfNgb3l2rJc4_jxhsOPwgnZ785p0os6mQHZApbfLrkOI5dTqwWwtolinFYFziUhci-txrgz1FqAAYLWPPnPUHvs7ExU0N2i-J-TUAnFCv2J9w.WmWDv80J0WU-nl8vbO4HwhElQq2YBSGSzZ97IAD3OfE&dib_tag=se&keywords=Hillbilly+Elegy.+A+Memoir+of+a+Family+and+Culture+in+Crisis+book&qid=1713792927&sr=8-1", 3.99, 80737, 2016,1524),

An outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is on the cusp of womanhood--where greater pain awaits. And so when Caesar, a slave who has recently arrived from Virginia, urges her to join him on the Underground Railroad, she seizes the opportunity and escapes with him. In Colson Whitehead\'s ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor: engineers and conductors operate a secret network of actual tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora embarks on a harrowing flight from one state to the next, encountering, like Gulliver, strange yet familiar iterations of her own world at each stop. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the terrors of the antebellum era, he weaves in the saga of our nation, from the brutal abduction of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is both the gripping tale of one woman\'s will to escape the horrors of bondage--and a powerful meditation on the history we all share.

The story is set in the fictional town of Starkfield, Massachusetts, and is considered one of Wharton\'s masterpieces in the genre of American realism. Unlike her other works, which often explore the lives of the upper-class society, \"Ethan Frome\" delves into the life of an impoverished farmer, Ethan Frome, and his tragic domestic life in a small New England town.The narrative is framed by an unnamed narrator who becomes curious about Frome during a winter stay in Starkfield. Through the narrator\'s inquiries and a subsequent flashback, the main story of Ethan Frome is revealed. Ethan is trapped in a loveless marriage with his ailing and hypochondriac wife, Zeena. Their lives are disrupted by the arrival of Mattie Silver, Zeena\'s cousin, who comes to live with them and assist in the household.Ethan falls in love with Mattie, drawn to her youthful energy and warmth, which starkly contrast with Zeena\'s cold and querulous demeanor. The novel meticulously details Ethan\'s emotional turmoil and the eventual catastrophic consequences of his and Mattie\'s attempt to escape their dreary circumstances.Wharton\'s depiction of the harsh and bleak New England winter landscape mirrors the desolation and entrapment felt by her characters. The novel explores themes of duty, desire, and the crushing effects of poverty and isolation on the human spirit. \"Ethan Frome\" is renowned for its tight structure, economy of language, and its powerful, if grim, portrayal of the depth and complexity of human emotions within the constraints of societal norms and personal circumstances.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Ethan-Frome-EDITH-WHARTON/dp/B0D21LPB9C/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.MjZqjLPsmwwThwLLIFfwgJPjnVhuYDeHDnRAN2xapQ0F0pc6bdN5cggELNjmeLwkrEdgF3y9lxHwdKTMM11NxX63A--Jxelqkxi6I1fckAgX9JJHQQLZDqDpIjMNgFE-EEJIKdEyUPNTLs_oYRqd7REuz3q9FmwCVnlOSUcyLcgn1qN7-N9kUt8inI9ZEK8nNcEhTnVEyPFT4Wmmekg-s_lsXeC7MArIFUmKBGSvor8wL3aXY_Rb4CmWU6cqbXs24t0ulVEnMIOEe2M3ZgnHZ6CYgdZKgm1cQvVO0yUbH1c.598Z1x7cYZIcSoniZ28-6QPoW1mlLJ6dnBMlr6FAGFE&dib_tag=se&keywords=Ethan+Frome+book&qid=1713793228&sr=8-1", 3.35, 72421, 1911,1566),

Nursing homes, devoted above all to safety, battle with residents over the food they are allowed to eat and the choices they are allowed to make. Doctors, uncomfortable discussing patients\' anxieties about death, fall back on false hopes and treatments that are actually shortening lives instead of improving them.

Haunted by the figure of Mr. Duck -- the name by which the Thai police have identified the dead man -- and his own obsession with Vietnam movies, Richard sets off with a young French couple to an island hidden away in an archipelago forbidden to tourists. They discover the Beach, and it is as beautiful and idyllic as it is reputed to be. Yet over time it becomes clear that Beach culture, as Richard calls it, has troubling, even deadly, undercurrents. Spellbinding and hallucinogenic, The Beach by Alex Garland -- both a national bestseller and his debut -- is a highly accomplished and suspenseful novel that fixates on a generation in their twenties, who, burdened with the legacy of the preceding generation and saturated by popular culture, long for an unruined landscape, but find it difficult to experience the world firsthand.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Beach-Alex-Garland/dp/1573226521/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Cx8VyRsP8oVPr7dRKZtwobI6wRrlivFdCOmVBTg7rqGEQbzvx-6PmEHnmNN5JqGEfxg5CD9M7m9IowlfL8h-uQTACeNizKZQn910bKlzhtxil6J1_PSaJ6id2KCs19we_w4EAiCkOde4s4RFuX3VfQZ4Z3xBvSGAb9SenEo8nHbVI8jSg3nL6LYOlNMItQppyRT2LN2jEknbj6qw_JXOeNggjzBX1mzHd3nBCVysw46IlIlDYkfFyrY-bCqkC9j2hzPEMq6lizLGhKE6mlOB7Vz-KIoqBciUmi8q6334KUo.qLfKW7WB9TZoeSsVuj5r4-tOS1uQ4z0ZGod4T5DFaAw&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Beach+book&qid=1713793380&sr=8-1", 3.91, 52333, 1996,1586),

Henry Prize and other awards, and “Riding the Bullet,” which attracted over half a million online readers and became the most famous short story of the decade, as well as stories first published in The New Yorker, “1408,” made into a movie starring John Cusack.“Riding the Bullet” is the story of Alan Parker, who’s hitchhiking to see his dying mother but takes the wrong ride, farther than he ever intended. In “Lunch at the Gotham Café,” a sparring couple’s contentious lunch turns very, very bloody when the maître d’ gets out of sorts. “1408,” the audio story in print for the first time, is about a successful writer whose specialty is “Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Graveyards,” or “Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Houses,” and though Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel doesn’t kill him, he won’t be writing about ghosts anymore. And in “That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French,” terror is déjà vu at 16,000 feet. Whether writing about encounters with the dead, the near dead, or about the mundane dreads of life, from quitting smoking to yard sales, Stephen King is at the top of his form in the fourteen “brilliantly creepy” (USA TODAY) tales assembled in Everything’s Eventual. Intense, eerie, and instantly compelling, they announce the stunningly fertile imagination of perhaps the greatest storyteller of our time.

In the bitter cold, Ralph Truitt, a successful businessman, stands alone on a train platform waiting for the woman who answered his newspaper advertisement for \"a reliable wife.\" But when Catherine Land steps off the train from Chicago, she\'s not the \"simple, honest woman\" that Ralph is expecting. She is both complex and devious, haunted by a terrible past and motivated by greed. Her plan is simple: she will win this man\'s devotion, and then, ever so slowly, she will poison him and leave Wisconsin a wealthy widow. What she has not counted on, though, is that Truitt ― a passionate man with his own dark secrets ―has plans of his own for his new wife.

For seventeen-year-old Davey is sitting up in bed waiting for them with a Winchester rifle. His younger brother Reuben has seen their father perform miracles, but Jeremiah now seems as powerless to prevent Davey from being arrested for manslaughter, as he has always been to ease Reuben\'s daily spungy struggle to breathe. Nor does brave and brilliant nine-year-old Swede, obsessed as she is with the legends of the wild west, have the strength to spring Davey from jail. Yet Davey does manage to break out. He steals a horse, and disappears. His family feels his absence so sorely, the three of them just pile into their old Plymouth, towing a brand new 1963 Airstream trailer, and set out on a quest to find him. And they follow the outlaw west, right into the cold, wild and empty Dakota Badlands.Set in the 1960s on the edge of the Great Plains, PEACE LIKE A RIVER is that rare thing, a contemporary novel with an epic dimension. Told in the touching voice of an asthmatic eleven-year-old boy, it revels in the legends of the West, resonates with a soul-expanding sense of place, and vibrates with the possibility of magic in the everyday world. Above all, it shows how family, love, and faith can stand up to the most terrifying of enemies, the most tragic of fates.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Peace-Like-River-Leif-Enger/dp/1472154509/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZ9bsRtxinqt-iMJZ1MoCoxIJQVM39mDSbGpi_BU_lyexS3DHEVuNgMg1lGUkksPSyy2BxMChXNW7zUl5UHE657KyuyPq-WRXpeuC9qdWNte9gqbkzcQYtOshycCnHBcEMEftlaZr12q9d-4sHKbwFCOalvur3VpkXpU412RexyWP710A2-RU2KIt3YZKws114TuzzwFY9R7oMNxu3VCvOe0zxDiEdKEADaxjBLvyNbwlbEWyFeS0qVnrYqh1jEWRHj4KoQqjUa2-RWxoyTu_0wG-G6vKgW2YZ8XVC7hbdc.P4Zx8LpzsgNhEGQihCzNGx9vGhBdptYdAI1JZgMULGg&dib_tag=se&keywords=Peace+Like+a+River+book&qid=1713794299&sr=8-1", 3.98, 59642, 2001,1644),

Same Kind of Different as Me was a major motion picture by Paramount in fall 2017. Gritty with pain and betrayal and brutality, this true story also shines with an unexpected, life-changing love. Meet Denver, raised under plantation-style slavery in Louisiana until he escaped the \"Man\" - in the 1960\'s - by hopping a train. Non-trusting, uneducated, and violent, he spent another 18 years on the streets of Dallas and Fort Worth. Meet Ron Hall, a self-made millionaire in the world of high priced art deals -- concerned with fast cars, beautiful women, and fancy clothes. And the woman who changed their lives -- Miss Debbie: \"The skinniest, nosiest, pushiest, woman I ever met, black or white.\" She helped the homeless and gave of herself to all of \"God\'s People,\" and had a way of knowing how to listen and helping others talk and be found - until cancer strikes. Same Kind of Different as Me is a tale told in two unique voices - Ron Hall & Denver Moore - weaving two completely different life experiences into one common journey where both men learn \"whether we is rich or poor or something in between this earth ain\'t no final restin\' place. So in a way, we is all homeless-just workin\' our way toward home. The story takes a devastating twist when Deborah discovers she has cancer. Will Deborah live or die? Will Denver learn to trust a white man? Will Ron embrace his dying wife\'s vision to rescue Denver? Or will Denver be the one rescuing Ron? There\'s pain and laughter, doubt and tears, and in the end a triumphal story that readers will never forget.

Lawrence ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81sBbwlEHwL._SY466_.jpg", "Notes and Introduction by David Ellis, University of Kent at Canterbury. With its four-letter words and its explicit descriptions of sexual intercourse, Lady Chatterley\'s Lover is the novel with which D.H. Lawrence is most often associated. First published privately in Florence in 1928, it only became a world-wide best-seller after Penguin Books had successfully resisted an attempt by the British Director of Public Prosecutions to prevent them offering an unexpurgated edition. The famous \'Lady Chatterley trial\' heralded the sexual revolution of the coming decades and signalled the defeat of Establishment prudery. Yet Lawrence himself was hardly a liberationist and the conservativism of many aspects of his novel would later lay it open to attacks from the political avant-garde and from feminists. The story of how the wife of Sir Clifford Chatterley responds when her husband returns from the war paralysed from the waist down, and of the tender love which then develops between her and her husband\'s gamekeeper, is a complex one open to a variety of conflicting interpretations. This edition of the novel offers an occasion for a new generation of readers to discover what all the fuss was about; to appraise Lawrence\'s bitter indictment of modern industrial society, and to ask themselves what lessons there might be for the 21st century in his intense exploration of the complicated relations between love and sex.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Lady-Chatterleys-Lover-D-H-Lawrence/dp/1840224886/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2HtQAd0peeAV_NqyyjbkEokhQ_OuiaoyKlx5-t6Zc0QSeMcQuHky8o5ozro_ibpwWjz2TMYHWYNyooZ3zt2ijp9iV4wL5g7MiezdtdxXsFTOLK3a56ZgXv44NmW7eVJzexjHXd8qZQvvHJdCvGLRAuY-jF5exYspiGOa9tBlVmHU3d_mLP0W6lZfk5PkjI9Jvod6TuC4VxubGSHfSmDXOASj15Zrmljo5eZukQhbIuwP9WbQQHTy2IwQg7GbH2oNTjvkf1geelXnuo6nq1SSauvT-MXKhrJkjkwzg4jP5VU.9ctu7wDcxm_eVCTBSKw6go2Kf6i5rPUT9AV5ayWxSg8&dib_tag=se&keywords=Lady+Chatterley%27s+Lover+book&qid=1713794558&sr=8-1", 3.49, 46541, 1928,1681),

Her mother, to whom she hasn’t spoken for many years, comes to see her. Gentle gossip about people from Lucy’s childhood in Amgash, Illinois, seems to reconnect them, but just below the surface lie the tension and longing that have informed every aspect of Lucy’s life: her escape from her troubled family, her desire to become a writer, her marriage, her love for her two daughters. Knitting this powerful narrative together is the brilliant storytelling voice of Lucy herself: keenly observant, deeply human, and truly unforgettable.Praise for My Name Is Lucy Barton “A quiet, sublimely merciful contemporary novel about love, yearning, and resilience in a family damaged beyond words.”—The Boston Globe“It is Lucy’s gentle honesty, complex relationship with her husband, and nuanced response to her mother’s shortcomings that make this novel so subtly powerful.”—San Francisco Chronicle“A short novel about love, particularly the complicated love between mothers and daughters, but also simpler, more sudden bonds . . . It evokes these connections in a style so spare, so pure and so profound the book almost seems to be a kind of scripture or sutra, if a very down-to-earth and unpretentious one.”—Newsday“Spectacular . . .

And in South London, in a genteel Camberwell villa, a large silent house now bereft of brothers, husband and even servants, life is about to be transformed, as impoverished widow Mrs Wray and her spinster daughter, Frances, are obliged to take in lodgers.For with the arrival of Lilian and Leonard Barber, a modern young couple of the \'clerk class\', the routines of the house will be shaken up in unexpected ways. And as passions mount and frustration gathers, no one can foresee just how far-reaching, and how devastating, the disturbances will be.This is vintage Sarah Waters: beautifully described with excruciating tension, real tenderness, believable characters, and surprises. It is above all a wonderful, compelling story.\'You will be hooked within a page . . . At her greatest, Waters transcends genre: the delusions in Affinity (1999), the vulnerability in Fingersmith (2002), the undercurrents of social injustice and the unexplained that underlie all her work, take her, in my view, well beyond the capabilities of her more seriously regarded Booker-winning peers. But The Paying Guests is the apotheosis of her talent; at least for now. I have tried and failed to find a single negative thing to say about it. Her next will probably be even better. Until then, read it, Flaubert, Zola, and weep\' -Charlotte Mendelson, Financial Times", "https://www.amazon.sg/Paying-Guests-shortlisted-Womens-Fiction/dp/0349004609/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.u5kYgOGFGj2bTGJ9Skgo1wf_rA4PA1x9quKlnbbMsTgbNZCeZi0sIliMgZESByH1v8FEWwqBAKqH9_nm-XDGXv6IuGK123OIZ3JeSWdmtoVK76tpMLW0s02HAvGhQtXdhgVLSsq2v3FMgc0kk3d6OXkRtQFDO4E2Y9wGn_0YB8_v5xcCxMpjQgxcq7HaZy45VShyWDf-aYyrBFiIm0QjuraynOigiSzkapnWcdTLgXBejPVwCex_oLrdUZvhvUdNHjsKIczLoqKT2jqOzlh-SjDokFPVo96nowBHG9YW0p0.vyk8e1n2dl3BSRypJKXUdQa2VdMpqPLeFwC0UxuIBfo&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Paying+Guests+book&qid=1713794762&sr=8-1", 3.39, 44839, 2014,1708),

For such a character, one book is not enoughreaders must know what happens next. Now Dean Koontz returns with the novel his fans have been demanding. With the emotional power and sheer storytelling artistry that are his trademarks, Koontz takes up once more the story of a unique young hero and an eccentric little town in a tale that is equal parts suspense and terror, adventure and mysteryand altogether irresistibly odd.Were all a little odd beneath the surface. Hes the most unlikely hero youll ever meetan ordinary guy with a modest job you might never look at twice. But theres so much more to any of us than meets the eyeand that goes triple for Odd Thomas. For Odd lives always between two worlds in the small desert town of Pico Mundo, where the heroic and the harrowing are everyday events. Odd never asked to communicate with the deadits something that just happened. But as the unofficial goodwill ambassador between our world and theirs, hes got a duty to do the right thing. Thats the way Odd sees it and thats why hes won hearts on both sides of the divide between life and death.A childhood friend of Odds has disappeared. The worst is feared. But as Odd applies his unique talents to the task of finding the missing person, he discovers something worse than a dead body, encounters an enemy of exceptional cunning, and spirals into a vortex of terror. Once again Odd will stand against our worst fears. Around him will gather new allies and old, some living and some not. For in the battle to come, there can be no innocent bystanders, and every sacrifice can tip the balance between despair and hope. Whether youre meeting Odd Thomas for the first time or hes already an old friend, youll be led on an unforgettable journey through a world of terror, wonder and delightto a revelation that can change your life. And you can have no better guide than Odd Thomas.From the Hardcover edition.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Forever-Odd-Dean-R-Koontz/dp/0553588265/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9._GzWeZGdzLP7QLRkqg-1dzghiMDmx4f8ETfl0PkY610rHqKi1vlvdUSICeIQAWd13Nm338irflOdy0WCuqAYwGYeJFKUSfHhDXhVCDrpr_I-9s2MMHgd3c6UWmXJ57RIdvehT7bx0Z-XYvYWPMrHAP3taHm3LrhE60vie-0d34wli29HYYALaCMMiM7Z39NAiIs8bamNHVgG0thH-l0ThAckyENeiMdd0w9qEXbUshgPNDgyRFd-5zZuOXNXR9if1Qvg2GSOw7DQEluDRcDTH7u6yupZxdR0fxue9sbeG-g.TroFYTA9vle3rurfCchHl_ORckY8vZXTTCW7hMEIbVI&dib_tag=se&keywords=Forever+Odd+book&qid=1713794775&sr=8-1", 3.96, 54958, 2005,1709),

He is quick to offer Helen his friendship, but when her reclusive behaviour becomes the subject of local gossip and speculation, Gilbert begins to wonder whether his trust in her has been misplaced. It is only when she allows Gilbert to read her diary that the truth is revealed and the shocking details of the disastrous marriage she has left behind emerge. Told with great immediacy, combined with wit and irony, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is a powerful depiction of a woman\'s fight for domestic independence and creative freedom.

That one bite changed her life forever, pulling her into the abyss of a devastating illness that took ten doctors to diagnose and years to recover: Newby had become one of the 300,000 Americans who are afflicted with Lyme disease each year.As a science writer, she was driven to understand why this disease is so misunderstood, and its patients so mistreated. This quest led her to Willy Burgdorfer, the Lyme microbe’s discoverer, who revealed that he had developed bug-borne bioweapons during the Cold War, and believed that the Lyme epidemic was started by a military experiment gone wrong.In a superb, meticulous work of narrative journalism, Bitten takes readers on a journey to investigate these claims, from biological weapons facilities to interviews with biosecurity experts and microbiologists doing cutting-edge research, all the while uncovering darker truths about Willy. It also leads her to uncomfortable questions about why Lyme can be so difficult to both diagnose and treat, and why the government is so reluctant to classify chronic Lyme as a disease.A gripping, infectious page-turner, Bitten will shed a terrifying new light on an epidemic that is exacting an incalculable toll on us, upending much of what we believe we know about it.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Bitten-History-Disease-Biological-Weapons/dp/0062896288/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IhTLVDcEpFd2AYzSuBlepOSOMks8koq-19f1SKPpERQcOGSqZBX6c8mijJP25e4Zxm6vjP84DohQO1iQiprtKJqpRQVucH-2SUoG2s0qA7yuw7PnOotLmh3A60bgcTywgpQ-1ZzOCpkSF4g5CfXV3gDXDfQRVoCuubfdgXn_rTcmhBhmhmXH1FirXPpxbEi76miQChTFFi4Z-INEvZlmhLAK_PPHbLagJmmZAsXtgjlYEA_TwcfoJvHq_SLyM5zdN5IPnJhwj3hcPlq67vyVTNjahwa-l5QqmdpbLFlkZpY.DSLj-Uo7AK53Sx-PXgXowtgnglP866QWakJUOikVyCo&dib_tag=se&keywords=Bitten+book&qid=1713795278&sr=8-1", 4.06, 71988, 2001,1779),

And that\'s what Furiously Happy is all about.\" Jenny\'s readings are standing room only, with fans lining up to have Jenny sign their bottles of Xanax or Prozac as often as they are to have her sign their books. Furiously Happy appeals to Jenny\'s core fan base but also transcends it. There are so many people out there struggling with depression and mental illness, either themselves or someone in their family--and in Furiously Happy they will find a member of their tribe offering up an uplifting message (via a taxidermied roadkill raccoon). Let\'s Pretend This Never Happened ostensibly was about embracing your own weirdness, but deep down it was about family.

Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster.

Its magnificent hero, Cyrano--noble of soul and grotesque in appearance, gallant Gascon soldier, brilliant wit, and timid lover, alternately comic, heroic, tragic--represents one of the most challenging of all acting roles in its complexity and mercurial changes of mood. From its original production to the present day, Cyrano de Bergerac has enjoyed a charmed existence on the stage, its unflagging pace of action and eloquence of language enchanting critics and public alike.

    Book("1563892251", "A Doll\'s House", 13.3, "Henrik Ibsen ", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lrZ7w-zsL._SY466_.jpg", "A Doll\'s House (Norwegian: Et dukkehjem; also translated as A Doll House) is a three-act play in prose by Henrik Ibsen. It premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 21 December 1879, having been published earlier that month. The play is significant for its critical attitude toward 19th century marriage norms. It aroused great controversy at the time, as it concludes with the protagonist, Nora, leaving her husband and children because she wants to discover herself. Ibsen was inspired by the belief that \"a woman cannot be herself in modern society,\" since it is \"an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint.\" Its ideas can also be seen as having a wider application: Michael Meyer argued that the play\'s theme is not women\'s rights, but rather \"the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person.\" In a speech given to the Norwegian Association for Women\'s Rights in 1898, Ibsen insisted that he \"must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women\'s rights movement,\" since he wrote \"without any conscious thought of making propaganda,\" his task having been \"the description of humanity.\"", "https://www.amazon.sg/Dolls-House-Henrik-Ibsen/dp/1503213803/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.MflpygNKRMtNKGGNI8O_ZyGvqHe9HpFZGOUQXrB7_iAZec1voH5vKbXg42kBM-glTk0KxqCMBYyqOAIoQlzwfcAvfvYWmkFHcNvHKOS2aTtZAPMa4C6jVHio3GQMsct1Z__eHHnQD1UmGy3wo0tiBEGHszpld8r41xI36vFoNdeA0fBVn1IOshr8Kw03vukAbNuophTHOzt91rmaBFiJQ6uc0XcVu3G7n7wBQ3uUx37VHxynSJApt0ip3ViZ5YjPIdz6Tuj6-karwsRJDIBd7p3HXZZeSKOsbE-woWdudfM.4hancCFkPDFGB55KwAeiPmJF4bZZMk9qoUtTfXDB1NA&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Doll%27s+House+book&qid=1713795936&sr=8-1", 4.44, 54420, 1990,1895),

Twenty years later, Alina is dead and Mac has returned to the country that expelled them to hunt her sister’s murderer. But after discovering that she descends from a bloodline both gifted and cursed, Mac is plunged into a secret history: an ancient conflict between humans and immortals who have lived concealed among us for thousands of years. What follows is a shocking chain of events with devastating consequences, and now Mac struggles to cope with grief while continuing her mission to acquire and control the Sinsar Dubh—a book of dark, forbidden magic scribed by the mythical Unseelie King, containing the power to create and destroy worlds. In an epic battle between humans and Fae, the hunter becomes the hunted when the Sinsar Dubh turns on Mac and begins mowing a deadly path through those she loves. Who can she turn to?

A wealthy man has vanished, a whore has tried to end her life, and an enormous fortune has been discovered in the home of a luckless drunk.

Now, from the AGI-Goldratt Institute and Jeff Cox, the same creative writer who co-authored The Goal, comes VELOCITY, the book that reveals how to achieve outstanding bottom-line results by integrating the world\'s three most powerful continuous improvement disciplines: Lean, Six Sigma, and Goldratt\'s Theory of Constraints. Used by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps to dramatically improve some of the most complex, logistically vast supply chains in the world, the VELOCITY APPROACH draws on the strengths of all three disciplines to deliver breakthrough performance gains. In physics, speed with direction is velocity; in business, the application of VELOCITY means your organization can achieve operational speed with strategic direction to outmaneuver competitors, gain loyalty with customers, and rapidly build sustainable earnings growth -- in as little as one or two business quarters. Dee Jacob and Suzan Bergland, two princi-pals of AGI, have been teaching the concepts, techniques, and tools of VELOCITY to major corporations, including Procter & Gamble, ITT, and Northrop Grumman, for years. Now they unlock the door for you to see how to apply their insights and methods to your organization -- be it business, not-for-profit, manufacturing, or service based -- in order to shorten lead times, slash inventories, reduce production variability, and increase sales. Writer Jeff Cox returns with the vivid, realistic style that made The Goal so readable yet so edifying. Thrust into the presidency of the subsidiary company where she has managed sales and marketing, Amy Cieolara is mandated by her corporate superiors to implement Lean Six Sigma (LSS) in order to appease a key customer. Assigned to help her is LSS Master Black Belt Wayne Reese, installed as her operations manager. But as time goes on and corporate pressure mounts, Amy finds she has to start thinking for herself -- and learning from everyone around her -- and she arrives at the series of steps that form the core of the VELOCITY APPROACH. VELOCITY offers keen insight into the human and organizational factors that so often derail growth while teaching you proven, practical techniques for restarting and revving up the internal engines of your company to reach new levels of success. Colorful characters, believable situations, and everything from dice games to AGI\'s \"reality tree\" techniques make this business novel a vital resource for everyone seeking to deliver business improvement in these challenging economic times -- and far into the future.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Velocity-Combining-Constraints-Breakthrough-Performance/dp/1439158932/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vdHco8u4NLXjwuGw0izcEf00tdzXst7p5N3xRZj2h-vUO3__FjOCssYkwMk6-jE7BqTj9v-i_GhAReLYo81-VHx6a2p7j-Tg2pE5URaYMovUjWEY_Rqx4Wbblu-jO-CosccM0MRmw_LDP966SdpZrJT9Y1RMDJx85FKkHBKe4vGY_hqHzHxxHrcuVBigUoDIMF30UX17hgGGoV_W_DI-ImkDFBXPRsGQh9eSAWUfrJxpmxkEomMnNJQzhfi_oTxDxRyXHD66l8Atbe2cES3x4mXxFkGHUP4CHdrQ2aVdJa4.g9l_C6XuLpheRnhZQ2T07zJ1vI_vr20Ml_AS6dMpwlk&dib_tag=se&keywords=Velocity+book&qid=1713796076&sr=8-1", 3.85, 48755, 2005,1922),

Lewis\'s Space Trilogy, of which Out of the Silent Planet is the first volume, stands alongside such works as Albert Camus\'s The Plague and George Orwell\'s 1984 as a timeless classic, beloved by succeeding generations as much for the sheer wonder of its storytelling as for the significance of its moral concerns. While searching for a place to rest for the night, Dr. Elwin Ransom is abducted by a megalomaniacal physicist and his accomplice and taken to the red planet of Malacandra (Mars) as a human sacrifice for the alien creatures that live there. Once on the planet, however, Ransom eludes his captors, risking his life and his chances of returning to Earth, becoming a stranger in a land that is enchanting in its difference from Earth and instructive in its similarity. First published in 1943, Out of the Silent Planet remains a magnificent and suspenseful tour de force in which epic battles are fought between the forces of light and those of darkness.

Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain and her family may live in a ramshackle old English castle, but that\'s about as romantic as her life gets. While her beautiful older sister, Rose, longs to live in a Jane Austen novel, Cassandra knows that meeting an eligible man to marry isn\'t in either of their futures when their home is crumbling and they have to sell their furniture for food. So Cassandra instead strives to hone her writing skills in her journals. Until one day when their new landlords move in, which include two (very handsome) sons, and the lives of the Mortmain sisters change forever. Through Cassandra\'s sharply funny, yet poignant, journal entries, she chronicles the great changes that take place within the castle\'s walls, and her own first descent into love. By the time she pens her final entry, she has \"captured the castle\" - and the heart of the reader - in one of literature\'s most enchanting novels. \"This book has one of the most charismatic narrators I\'ve ever met.\" --J.K.

Signing with Oakland, he said goodbye to his small home town and left for California to pursue his dreams of glory.Six years later he was back, his dreams broken by a bad arm and bad habits - drinking, drugs and women. He began to show signs of mental illness. Unable to keep a job, he moved in with his mother and slept 20 hours a day on her sofa.In 1982, a 21 year-old cocktail waitress, Debra Sue Carter, was raped and murdered, and for five years the crime went unsolved. Finally, desperate for someone to blame, police came to suspect Ron Williamson and his friend Dennis Fritz. The two were finally arrested in 1987 and charged with murder.With no physical evidence, the prosecution\'s case was built on junk science and the testimony of jailhouse snitches and convicts. Dennis Fritz was found guilty and given a life sentence.Ron Williamson was sent to Death Row.But as Grisham methodically lays out, there was no case against him. Ron Williamson was wrongly condemned to die. If you believe that in America you are innocent until proven guilty, this book will shock you. If you believe in the death penalty, this book will disturb you. If you believe the criminal justice system is fair, this book will infuriate you.__________________In 2018, THE INNOCENT MAN was adapted by Netflix into a gripping six-part true crime series.__________________\'A master at the art of deft characterisation and the skilful delivery of hair-raising crescendos\' - Irish Independent\'John Grisham is the master of legal fiction\' - Jodi Picoult\'The best thriller writer alive\' - Ken Follett\'John Grisham has perfected the art of cooking up convincing, fast-paced thrillers\' - Telegraph \'Grisham is a superb, instinctive storyteller\' - The Times\'Grisham\'s storytelling genius reminds us that when it comes to legal drama, the master is in a league of his own.\' - Daily Record\'Masterful - when Grisham gets in the courtroom he lets rip, drawing scenes so real they\'re not just alive, they\'re pulsating\' - Mirror\'A giant of the thriller genre\' - TimeOut", "https://www.amazon.sg/Innocent-Man-thriller-behind-Netflix/dp/1784759414/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.EX4Lp5jt_GGDIJ7eOOkspb3YuD6pgxtF7SGTcS6CZEymDS99-3MNQ3imlLQRv7tOu-jIRDbM5Pd_vwxtU_inYGvDu3HDlqa5tq0UD5YjAUxqFCeDj9tS8yfDrk_X6azAPlNTYiZfUyC8FttCKCImiB-dx3EYFqYnhtsNZhogqgMaVKysAw6clB-mHTI-in1UEt2joriyRJGP4cBxIzDKWHy1xesoqB43Mlja4C8NF9e6kUFbV-G7Bvn25pYiIrO_s8gm4THQVQeXMxlgzDidVLnapTZ_2lraaafzHnHPssk.qh4UY_CJezywX2mbzgPdRI8OrXeJK_BEjHwF9_6yonY&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Innocent+Man+book&qid=1713797313&sr=8-1", 3.79, 43793, 2006,1986),

Lamb’s wonderful novel offers us the promise and power of hope.”—Miami HeraldWhen 47-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Connecticut to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm back east. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues. In The Hour I First Believed, Wally Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life.

Fans of The Paris Wife will be captivated by Circling the Sun, which . . . is both beautifully written and utterly engrossing.”—Ann Patchett, Country LivingPaula McLain, author of the phenomenal bestseller The Paris Wife, now returns with her keenly anticipated new novel, transporting readers to colonial Kenya in the 1920s. Circling the Sun brings to life a fearless and captivating woman—Beryl Markham, a record-setting aviator caught up in a passionate love triangle with safari hunter Denys Finch Hatton and Karen Blixen, who as Isak Dinesen wrote the classic memoir Out of Africa.Brought to Kenya from England as a child and then abandoned by her mother, Beryl is raised by both her father and the native Kipsigis tribe who share his estate. Her unconventional upbringing transforms Beryl into a bold young woman with a fierce love of all things wild and an inherent understanding of nature’s delicate balance. But even the wild child must grow up, and when everything Beryl knows and trusts dissolves, she is catapulted into a string of disastrous relationships.Beryl forges her own path as a horse trainer, and her uncommon style attracts the eye of the Happy Valley set, a decadent, bohemian community of European expats who also live and love by their own set of rules. But it’s the ruggedly charismatic Denys Finch Hatton who ultimately helps Beryl navigate the uncharted territory of her own heart. The intensity of their love reveals Beryl’s truest self and her fate: to fly.Set against the majestic landscape of early-twentieth-century Africa, McLain’s powerful tale reveals the extraordinary adventures of a woman before her time, the exhilaration of freedom and its cost, and the tenacity of the human spirit.Praise for Circling the Sun“In McLain’s confident hands, Beryl Markham crackles to life, and we readers truly understand what made a woman so far ahead of her time believe she had the power to soar.”—Jodi Picoult, author of Leaving Time“Enchanting . . . a worthy heir to [Isak] Dinesen . . . Like Africa as it’s so gorgeously depicted here, this novel will never let you go.”—The Boston Globe“Famed aviator Beryl Markham is a novelist’s dream. . . . [A] wonderful portrait of a complex woman who lived—defiantly—on her own terms.”—People (Book of the Week)“Circling the Sun soars.”—Newsday“Captivating . . . [an] irresistible novel.”—The Seattle Times“Like its high-flying subject, Circling the Sun is audacious and glamorous and hard not to be drawn in by. Beryl Markham may have married more than once, but she was nobody’s wife.”—Entertainment Weekly“[An] eloquent evocation of Beryl’s daring life.”—O: The Oprah Magazine“Markham’s life is the stuff of legend. . . . McLain has created a voice that is lush and intricate to evoke a character who is enviably brave and independent.”—NPR“Bold, absorbing fiction.”—New York Daily News“Paula McLain has such a gift for bringing characters to life.

She has failed to give him a son and her sharp intelligence and audacious will alienate his old friends and the noble families of England. When the discarded Katherine dies in exile from the court, Anne stands starkly exposed, the focus of gossip and malice. At a word from Henry, Thomas Cromwell is ready to bring her down. Over three terrifying weeks, Anne is ensnared in a web of conspiracy, while the demure Jane Seymour stands waiting her turn for the poisoned wedding ring. But Anne and her powerful family will not yield without a ferocious struggle. Hilary Mantel\'s Bring Up the Bodies follows the dramatic trial of the queen and her suitors for adultery and treason.

This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction by Sandra Kemp.The Moonstone, a priceless yellow diamond, is looted from an Indian temple and maliciously bequeathed to Rachel Verinder. On her eighteenth birthday, her friend and suitor Franklin Blake brings the gift to her. That very night, it is stolen again. No one is above suspicion, as the idiosyncratic Sergeant Cuff and the Franklin piece together a puzzling series of events as mystifying as an opium dream and as deceptive as the nearby Shivering Sand. The intricate plot and modern technique of multiple narrators made Wilkie Collins\'s 1868 work a huge success in the Victorian sensation genre. With a reconstruction of the crime, red herrings and a \'locked-room\' puzzle, The Moonstone was also a major precursor of the modern mystery novel.In her introduction Sandra Kemp explores The Moonstone\'s the detective elements of Collins\'s writing, and reveals how Collins\'s sensibilities were untypical of his era.Wilkie Collins (1824-1889) was born in London in 1824, the eldest son of the landscape painter William Collins. In 1846 he was entered to read for the bar at Lincoln\'s Inn, where he gained the knowledge that was to give him much of the material for his writing. From the early 1850s he was a friend of Charles Dickens, who produced and acted in two melodramas written by Collins, The Lighthouse and The Frozen Deep. Of his novels, Collins is best remembered for The Woman in White (1859), No Name (1862), Armadale (1866) and The Moonstone (1868).If you enjoyed The Moonstone you might like Collins\'s The Woman in White, also available in Penguin Classics.\'Probably the very finest detective story ever written\'Dorothy L.

He glides through life cocooned by his devoted family, his demanding yet highly rewarding (and lucrative) business, his sporting prowess, his good looks. He is the embodiment of thriving, post-war America, land of liberty and hope. Until the sunny day in 1968, when the Swede’s bountiful American luck deserts him.The tragedy springs from devastatingly close to home. His adored daughter, Merry, has become a stranger to him, a fanatical teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism that plunges the Levov family into the political mayhem of sixties America, and drags them into the underbelly of a seemingly ascendant society. Rendered powerless by the shocking turn of events, the Swede can only watch as his pastoral idyll is methodically torn apart. Extraordinarily nuanced and poignant, American Pastoral is the first in an eloquent trilogy of post-war American novels and cemented Roth’s reputation as one of the greatest American novelists of the twentieth century.‘Full of insight, full of sharp ironic twists, full of wisdom about American idealism, and full of terrific fun...

There, he encounters Emiko. Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe.What Happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism\'s genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution?

In Jordan\'s prize-winning debut, prejudice takes many forms, both subtle and brutal. It is 1946, and city-bred Laura McAllan is trying to raise her children on her husband\'s Mississippi Delta farm—a place she finds foreign and frightening. In the midst of the family\'s struggles, two young men return from the war to work the land. Jamie McAllan, Laura\'s brother-in-law, is everything her husband is not—charming, handsome, and haunted by his memories of combat. Ronsel Jackson, eldest son of the black sharecroppers who live on the McAllan farm, has come home with the shine of a war hero. But no matter his bravery in defense of his country, he is still considered less than a man in the Jim Crow South. It is the unlikely friendship of these brothers-in-arms that drives this powerful novel to its inexorable conclusion. The men and women of each family relate their versions of events and we are drawn into their lives as they become players in a tragedy on the grandest scale.

After being expelled from Rome, he spent the rest of his life living and teaching in Greece. He is now considered the most important exponent of Stoicism, and his surviving work comprises a series of impassioned discourses, delivered live and recorded by his student Arrian, and the Handbook, Arrian’s own take on the heart of Epictetus’s teaching. In Discourses, Epictetus argues that happiness depends on knowing what is in our power to affect and what is not. Our internal states and our responses to events are up to us, but the events themselves are assigned to us by the benevolent deity, and we should treat them―along with our bodies, possessions, and families―as matters of indifference, simply making the best use of them we can. Together, the Discourses and Handbook constitute a practical guide to moral self-improvement, as Epictetus explains the work and exercises aspirants need to do to enrich and deepen their lives. Edited and translated by renowned scholar Robin Waterfield, this book collects the complete works of Epictetus, bringing to modern readers his insights on how to cope with death, exile, the people around us, the whims of the emperor, fear, illness, and much more.CUSTOMER NOTE: THE HARDCOVER IS FOR LIBRARIES AND HAS NO JACKET.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Complete-Works-Handbook-Discourses-Fragments/dp/022676947X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.jkYHfIDycYj0VL953DobNXZ-OA1qJuWSGuiixj8GYw5pKhCc9iNFyO2HrgxlaCFt08J3ATJqdRv8Is-qV_4fuEz-nUfwOjbIbsUnbzqSrzAud9oVhjgu7xMn6oOdZAOy0GRtenXPpXqZOPFhP7tkZfc5i3DxzdcN_RQ_gs4pd0AH0tw4_tbyXKWABgADZGUVxC3PL_8J6ADT1kGjq7DIhNCh-1QFvmCilAtf28u8I26H8_wuDGakYbk8LAKl6trdEO_NPprkfdxHLKTYwnFB0r-d6_RGoBGVmzLRb6aVidk.ZSHystpMqXLTpsO-WUObZ0I3_TBfaARZLQ4Nisu4wbE&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Complete+Works+book&qid=1713798251&sr=8-1", 4.49, 39503, 1623,2209),

College student Joe Talbert has the modest goal of completing a writing assignment for an English class. His task is to interview a stranger and write a brief biography of the person. With deadlines looming, Joe heads to a nearby nursing home to find a willing subject. There he meets Carl Iverson, and soon nothing in Joe\'s life is ever the same. Carl is a dying Vietnam veteran--and a convicted murderer. With only a few months to live, he has been medically paroled to a nursing home, after spending thirty years in prison for the crimes of rape and murder. As Joe writes about Carl\'s life, especially Carl\'s valor in Vietnam, he cannot reconcile the heroism of the soldier with the despicable acts of the convict.

A tale of redemption, in which storytelling itself is the source of salvation, it won the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Rarely has a book so swiftly found its place on the literary landscape.And now we have ’Tis, the story of Frank’s American journey from impoverished immigrant to brilliant teacher and raconteur. Frank lands in New York at age nineteen, in the company of a priest he meets on the boat. He gets a job at the Biltmore Hotel, where he immediately encounters the vivid hierarchies of this “classless country,” and then is drafted into the army and is sent to Germany to train dogs and type reports. It is Frank’s incomparable voice—his uncanny humor and his astonishing ear for dialogue—that renders these experiences spellbinding. When Frank returns to America in 1953, he works on the docks, always resisting what everyone tells him, that men and women who have dreamed and toiled for years to get to America should “stick to their own kind” once they arrive. Somehow, Frank knows that he should be getting an education, and though he left school at fourteen, he talks his way into New York University. There, he falls in love with the quintessential Yankee, long-legged and blonde, and tries to live his dream. But it is not until he starts to teach—and to write—that Frank finds his place in the world. The same vulnerable but invincible spirit that captured the hearts of readers in Angela’s Ashes comes of age. As Malcolm Jones said in his Newsweek review of Angela’s Ashes, “It is only the best storyteller who can so beguile his readers that he leaves them wanting more when he is done...and McCourt proves himself one of the very best.” Frank McCourt\'s ’Tis is one of the most eagerly awaited books of our time, and it is a masterpiece.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Tis-Memoir-Frank-McCourt/dp/0684865742/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DZF3vdhtw2ILadTjNN2LqDciYoyIDK4azvKpPFtbfzKCUUZf6Xc1TVLqsAZG3xXCKGvtvoHVLKAwb-bsQRBuQXfgmAijxsSQQJTZ6lUUhriQjxc4C0QIrcFlScWoyg5P7S15DpdUue0Jb9vz8CS_hGF0tWkqijpFqVCcLY7k5GPkbg15GV9uKV8gqtezDoDM4Fm6mVcBHsbnb_UuB8DExSAoBv7KXr0eq5_ExbYgcKKmdR5u6lmFR_4l9KZlp36fQJvFIfwCWmSnGZdtn1R7cfi6Xt6b9a97SkJPuVW9mgE.wZ1FGwS9zMkJSOMcZOlN8GSCrh8AWnq3TD2vQAd7Crw&dib_tag=se&keywords=%27Tis%3A+A+Memoir+book&qid=1713798368&sr=8-1", 3.66, 40726, 1999,2252),

This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction and notes by Donald McFarlan and a foreword by Alasdair Gray.Orphaned and penniless, David Balfour sets out to find his last living relative, miserly and reclusive Uncle Ebenezer. But Ebenezer is far from welcoming, and David narrowly escapes being murdered before he is kidnapped and imprisoned on a ship bound for the Carolinas. When the ship is wrecked, David, along with the fiery rebel Alan Breck, makes his way back across the treacherous Highland terrain on a quest for justice. Through his powerful depiction of the two very different central characters - the romantic Breck and the rational Whig David - Stevenson dramatized a conflict at the heart of Scottish culture in the aftermath of the Jacobite rebellion, as well as creating an unforgettable adventure story.This new edition includes a foreword by Alasdair Gray discussing Stevenson\'s life and literary career and how he came to write Kidnapped. In his introduction, Donald McFarlan considers the novel\'s realism and a depiction of Scotland. This volume also includes a historical note, a map, notes, new further reading and a glossary.Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) was born in Edinburgh, the son of a prosperous civil engineer. Although he began his career as an essayist and travel writer, the success of Treasure Island (1883) and Kidnapped (1886) established his reputation as a writer of tales of action and adventure. Stevenson\'s Calvinist upbringing lent him a preoccupation with predestination and a fascination with the presence of evil, themes he explored in The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886), and The Master of Ballantrae (1893).If you enjoyed Kidnapped, you might like Jack London\'s The Call of the Wild, White Fang, and Other Stories, also available in Penguin Classics.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Kidnapped-Robert-Louis-Stevenson/dp/0141441798/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ozuygEog-g6sJmj_-ol6cPyXkcyoap6R_oZRfX7TvtuAvt5fCzBxLgJbGtR2aT2DcePEz-fgnqldeQYQlhpCL8N_Jly7yBe175r7S5OL7-vJdKijjRidTbWdTkUXKber1ssLqiIEQrM7lGf8DQ7Jhk_TtwBlKMfv3GWNzVhudfIHQQ4Lew-a1ZYTRPenDQf945ZqE8Oxumd77UAG5FhREKXyBZf6rMm-Kj4X0MKAd5n6hTH_CE2QqLW1USHqtunxN9NBVgoRsMeFVtQVEX5CjPzv0a-9NF4chmg6Tm-ldTQ.jUg5QZga6KxA3znHP237_hWuJbls_Sh3s9sGLH-b60I&dib_tag=se&keywords=Kidnapped+book&qid=1713798605&sr=8-1", 3.78, 44150, 1886,2361),

The story, set in an unnamed Italian city at carnival time in an unspecified year, is about a man taking fatal revenge on a friend who, he believes, has insulted him. Like several of Poe\'s stories, and in keeping with the 19th-century fascination with the subject, the narrative revolves around a person being buried alive - in this case, by immurement. As in \"The Black Cat\" and \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", Poe conveys the story from the murderer\'s perspective.Summary: The story\'s narrator, Montresor, tells an unspecified person, who knows him very well, of the day he took his revenge on Fortunato (Italian for \"the fortunate one\"), a fellow nobleman. Angry over numerous injuries and some unspecified insult, Montresor plots to murder his \"friend\" during Carnival, while the man is drunk, dizzy, and wearing a jester\'s motley.Montresor lures Fortunato into a private wine-tasting excursion by telling him he has obtained a pipe (about 130 gallons, 492 litres) of what he believes to be a rare vintage of Amontillado. He proposes obtaining confirmation of the pipe\'s contents by inviting a fellow wine aficionado, Luchesi, for a private tasting. Montresor knows Fortunato will not be able to resist demonstrating his discerning palate for wine and will insist that he taste the amontillado rather than Luchesi who, as he claims, \"cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry\".", "https://www.amazon.sg/Cask-Amontillado-Edgar-Allan-Poe/dp/6057861027/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zLEQ7GTXECp77sYdgCs_I4muckOF7ifya4rRty7y7SDO2wOewyS8klBCyzxBGfPod01RT2CrL_imL3hWyfVCzj2uQ6xb3-in8XvrUynKw_JouOjJi-lO5AyClyxtWMqvcll2FODtiBh3pfJl0yGe47MT_RBlZ0jp1TJVbFJukwAiImLZaQCUgLcVP3bGne3jbI3hMEWvjR5YNmR_OaMesNlxADbgPTkf6ygrKeZIH2fI6VLsLKxrBN30oHuOnhOBt-BIfHmFwuGBa0eQof0I-HnxUGNt5vAqwPf6Rie2lTM.Isp2P2iVdpf5PwybEMyTQw3mHgusKsoqxP7OsBsx4go&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Cask+of+Amontillado+book&qid=1713798615&sr=8-1", 4.09, 48364, 1846,2365),

Beginning with the creation of the world and ending with the deification of Augustus, Ovid interweaves many of the best-known myths and legends of ancient Greece and Rome, including Daedalus and Icarus, Pyramus and Thisbe, Pygmalion, Perseus and Andromeda, and the fall of Troy. Erudite but light-hearted, dramatic and yet playful, Metamorphoses has influenced writers and artists throughout the centuries from Shakespeare and Titian to Picasso and Ted Hughes.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

His two sons have returned home for the occasion: Gooper, his wife and children, Brick, an ageing football hero who has turned to drink, and his feisty wife Maggie. As the hot summer evening unfolds, the veneer of happy family life and Southern gentility gradually slips away as unpleasant truths emerge and greed, lies, jealousy and suppressed sexuality threaten to reach boiling point. Made into a film starring Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a masterly portrayal of family tensions and individuals trapped in prisons of their own making.Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) was born in Columbus, Mississippi. When his father, a travelling salesman, moved with his family to St Louis some years later, both he and his sister found it impossible to settle down to city life. He entered college during the Depression and left after a couple of years to take a clerical job in a shoe company. He stayed there for two years, spending the evenings writing. He received a Rockefeller Fellowship in 1940 for his play Battle of Angels, and he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 and 1955. Among his many other plays Penguin have published The Glass Menagerie (1944), The Rose Tattoo (1951), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955), Sweet Bird of Youth (1959), The Night of the Iguana (1961), and Small Craft Warnings (1972).If you enjoyed Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, you might like Williams\'s The Glass Menagerie, also published in Penguin Modern Classics.\'Tennessee Williams will live as long as drama itself ... he is, quite simply, indispensable\'Peter Shaffer, author of Equus", "https://www.amazon.sg/Cat-Hot-Roof-Tennessee-Williams/dp/0141190280/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.cQ_2NxbnIKPHovz2wxp-tEt1qLTmlJyWEelkdVGO_w6oitEpgbNaP_8lJQ1cGFskJjPS0bYDGWcbloBOBuMBx4Jv41dtvBtHWR-tOuXIzZjhUxg8YTteTwHub86TDIHFBErq95XKR56YivyUg4AC4FSxi6RP5fCl4t8plEdSaOD8Qdg4dor8xBsuSMNO-DHBz-aA3Lbeu53t3ZYKpZetRcBx-t5PNlGJWnrrqkAJfg4tNE-O-9Q20upi3g1tbXMCfb3I2JNqpzxykcPqugVhDhHcCTrw4D1YxgBxj5it0Zo.84_CTuC4AzmrNUz7-6FYD66G9Zbz3O1bibSvmDJEk94&dib_tag=se&keywords=Cat+on+a+Hot+Tin+Roof+book&qid=1713798652&sr=8-1", 4.07, 43781, 1955,2380),

But America is suffering a crisis of faith in persuasion that is putting its democracy and the planet itself at risk. People increasingly write each other off instead of seeking to win each other over. Debates are framed in moralistic terms, with enemies battling the righteous. Movements for justice build barriers to entry, instead of on-ramps. Political parties focus on mobilizing the faithful rather than wooing the sceptical. And leaders who seek to forge coalition are labelled sell-outs.In The Persuaders best-selling author Anand Giridharadas takes us inside these movements and battles, seeking out the dissenters who continue to champion persuasion in an age of polarization.

Conventional approaches to strategy development and problem solving no longer work―there is no stable industry or market equilibrium structure that we will return to “when change abates.” Most company planning processes are fantasy; market conditions are changing too quickly for arm-chair strategizing to be useful. As a consequence, many management teams are stuck in a wait-and-see posture in response to extreme uncertainty in the post-Covid environment, while others are making panicky bets, including ‘leap before you look’ acquisitions. In this sequel to their Amazon-bestseller, Bulletproof Problem Solving, Conn and McLean introduce a novel approach to strategic problem solving. Based on a decade of research and 30 new case studies, The Imperfectionists posits a dynamic approach to developing organizational direction under uncertainty based on harnessing six reinforcing strategic mindsets, which they call curiosity, dragonfly eye, occurrent behaviour, collective wisdom, imperfectionism, and show and tell. Imperfectionists are curious, they look at problems from several perspectives, and gather new data and approaches, including from outside their current industry. They deliberately step into risk, proceeding through trial and error, utilizing nimble low consequence and reversible moves to deepen their understanding of the unfolding game being played, and to build capabilities. They accept ambiguity and some apparent failures in exchange for improved learning and market position. Imperfectionists succeed with dynamic, real time strategic problem solving, confidently moving forward while others wait for certainty, or make impetuous and foolish bets. These strategic mindsets for solving tough problems in uncertain times help you fight decision biases and give you the data to develop informed strategies to win. In the fast changing world we all find ourselves in, being an imperfectionist is a critical advantage for you and your organization.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Imperfectionists-Strategic-Mindsets-Uncertain-Times/dp/1119835666/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0BjkBgWK1TCREo-UJRCflLcJKJCii6wR2Q079Zek9Hi0D1YEquBtETRozx4goYnwoO3R26L_utSgW0ZPmRqvvrTlZy1SH0gCf8RGI7WiInnaattfJMZtgoFzDdaq30FcyuGzTZV_WE2q3b7ojrcLBnfX44Xny9eVK_xW3Bo4_y7TSlTGlI906ddEhYDjvcsAg2KOTtDwWu0uqtp386DkdRsAn5T71w9D7C90BLwv1b809G9QdlAMxXlOt3gqLdUsjvsfwYqUItWW_kgh_tm4ShRNxGZJN313kGsu0azbEak.CAB3CT13ABvAkWBD0loxRzg3tb5oFURBGfBfvnxwhBg&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+Imperfectionists+book&qid=1713798770&sr=8-1", 3.54, 36571, 2010,2449),

The Sketch-Book (1820-1) looks simultaneously towards audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, as Irving explores the uneasy relationship of an American writer to English literary traditions. He sketches a series of encounters with the cultural shrines of the parent nation, and in two brilliant experiments with tales transplanted from Europe creates the first classic American short stories, \'Rip Van Winkle\' and \'The Legend of the Sleepy Hollow\'. The result was not only a hugely successful travel book; it exerted a strong formative influence on American writers from Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe to Henry James, and is well worth rediscovery in its own right today. Based on Irving\'s final revision of his most popular work, this new edition includes comprehensive explanatory notes of The Sketch-Book\'s sources for the modern reader. In her introduction, Susan Manning suggests that the author forged a new idiom, the \'Literary Picturesque\', to accommodate and turn to advantage his dilemma of dual literary allegiances.

Now Jack is a retired Los Angeles homicide detective living in the nearly xistent hamlet of Tamarack, Wisconsin. He has no recollection of his adventures in the Territories, and was compelled to leave the police force when an odd, happenstance event threatened to awaken those memories. When a series of gruesome murders occur in western Wisconsin that are reminiscent of those committed several decades ago by a madman named Albert Fish, the killer is dubbed “the Fishman,” and Jack’s buddy, the local chief of police, begs Jack to help the inexperienced force find him. But are these new killings merely the work of a disturbed individual, or has a mysterious and malignant force been unleashed in this quiet town? What causes Jack’s inexplicable waking dreams—if that is what they are—of robins’ eggs and red feathers? It’s almost as if someone is trying to tell him something. As this cryptic message becomes increasingly impossible to ignore, Jack is drawn back to the Territories and to his own hidden past, where he may find the soul-strength to enter a terrifying house at the end of a deserted tract of forest, there to encounter the obscene and ferocious evils sheltered within it.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Black-House-Novel-Stephen-King/dp/1501192299/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hmHNa64SrjDDSq8_f49LtUITI3nOedTz2nHGsIY10UimMwX9DfYIK3sPGugfyqQkxzctkF89vrOsfp5dyXPQX47dYjzaNSTIr_REUUNhmYFrBSOuLR_JreACtYhQF-mLLbG7CMbwfRVNLrb0FJ_gzfXnoHJtEftJ1KURRaC_Yog2nTBtXaBFU4kiTndk6SdQtIRDC6w40_j6KYr_iCbmQCdcf6DyCPVcyruMuewxmITo04XLcNp82S158AathoiSFBZD5YxwP_QiUjYj9n002c_J3Ej_QyZ_E26G2fINj9k.NyyY2oxhdbccR9rDyLIqBtzwKE_rr_VgitVS-cuUbIM&dib_tag=se&keywords=Black+House+book&qid=1713798980&sr=8-1", 3.99, 40734, 2001,2513),

He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children\'s gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Then he was discovered by the recruiters for the Battle School. For Earth was at war - a terrible war with an inscrutable alien enemy. A war that humanity was near to losing. But the long distances of interstellar space has given hope to the defenders of Earth - they had time to train military geniuses up from childhood, forging them into an irresistible force in the high-orbital facility called the Battle School. That story is told in two books, Orson Scott Card\'s beloved classic Ender\'s Game, and its parallel, Ender\'s Shadow. Now, in Shadow of the Giant, Bean\'s story continues. Bean was the smallest student at the Battle School, but he became Ender Wiggins\' right hand, Since then he has grown to be a power on Earth. He served the Hegemon as strategist and general in the terrible wars that followed Ender\'s defeat of the alien empire attacking Earth. Now he and his wife Petra yearn for a safe place to build a family - something he has never known - but there is nowhere on Earth that does not harbor his enemies - old enemies from the days in Ender\'s Jeesh, new enemies from the wars on Earth. To find security, Bean and Petra must once again follow in Ender\'s footsteps. They must leave Earth behind, in the control of the Hegemon, and look to the stars.

In “Ayana,” a blind girl works a miracle with a kiss and the touch of her hand. For King, the line between the living and the dead is often blurry, and the seams that hold our reality intact might tear apart at any moment.

They\'re out of the casket and want a bite of the future. But they haven’t met the neighbours yet: between them and Lancre stand Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg. And Magrat, who is trying to combine witchcraft and nappies. And young Agnes, although she is really in two minds about everything. Mightily Oats knows he has a prayer, but he wishes he had an axe.", "https://www.amazon.sg/Carpe-Jugulum-Discworld-Novel-23/dp/0857524151/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bga274o2lLRE4_1u14RneMdXzEXQV8Lg3xVakpOeVsE0_mhSCjj8T-t86wpIvBNThlowACne0AD6hKCc06FlkcVoU1Ia6a2ymjUGOM7Yr29NCCR2ATIeAtjRFYj3ngAWZRSvfKvX4upxfqOejtLFyCLk3le1ZZVhuZLkAJXbdOWLVSQ8EtGrQ96yyB0GMf3Q5pIl6YznlHwumsK11KKiA-G4-K3PFH3JjF8S5bfq0C9GSAVu7q-1-pK84BdVhgmI3rkV8eRdwZfnuZO6s3f-Pas-ygRVhHAreOCibt39OAE.zzu2rjNbVJVpkjjQN6NpjCcZ8DqS1jY-i6NI7vPyg80&dib_tag=se&keywords=Carpe+Jugulum+book&qid=1713799342&sr=8-1", 4.12, 35605, 1998,3200),
